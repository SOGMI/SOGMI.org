2018 is already shaping up to be a supernatural year, and many in the Body of Christ have shown increased eagerness to seek out God and His ways of doing things. Over the years more and more people from all over the world have asked us and been asking us to mentor and teach them about the prophetic, apostolic, and how to operate in the gifts of the Holy Spirit and follow His leading. Many also have been asking to attend our business schools for training and preparation for the transfer of wealth influence and affluence. Many times, we can’t even keep up with it all, but things are going to change starting this year!

Looking back, we at Sons of God Ministries International (SOGMI) haven’t done everything we can to get our message out to God’s people. It’s true that we have been regularly holding conferences and our radio show, [The Prophetic Voice of Our Time](/series/the-prophetic-voice-of-our-time/ "Listen to the Prophetic Voice of Our Time"), has been running more than 6 years now. We have seen God move mightily in these areas, however, there is so much revelation God has given us that we still haven’t been effectively sharing with our partners and members.

> He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much. – Luke 16:10 (ASV)

God has already given us so much knowledge and revelation. Over the past 15 years we’ve accumulated about 1.5 terabytes of audio teachings and more than 3 terabytes of video content. This isn’t even including all the audio stored on cassette tapes. (if you can remember that far back!) Because of this we have been working for the past several months to create an infrastructure so that we can properly sift through our content and send it out to you, and it all begins with expansion of this website. 

We believe that if we prove ourselves faithful with the revelation God has already given us the He will be able to trust us with even more. However, this will not only be a blessing for us, but also for you as God’s holy Church since you will be partakers of the same revelation and be able to gleam from it and apply it in your own lives.

## What to Expect Moving Forward

In 2018 we’re leaping forward into the modern age! Starting from the launch of this website SOGMI is going to use the full depth of our technical knowledge to bring you teachings, revelation, and more! Here are some things that you can expect moving forward:

### A Regular Stream of New Content and Teachings

Like I mentioned above, SOGMI has generated a lot of content in the past 15 years! I mean we’ve been sitting on 1.5 terabytes of audio and more than 3 terabytes of video. So we’ve put together a team to start sorting through the many revelations and teachings and deliver them to you. Our team is small at the moment, but we are committed to bring you these teachings! We want Sogmi.org to become a resource that people can refer to for years to come.

This is the first step towards further equipping the Body of Christ as we work towards creating the online prophetic and business schools.

### Livestreams of Services and Events

Starting in April we will begin offering weekly livestreams of the morning services at Freedom Fellowship Church and other events held by SOGMI. **The [first livestream](/live "Watch SOGMI Live") will take place April 1st at 11:00 am CST.** Don’t miss it!

### Improved Website Performance and Faster Download Times

Many of our podcast subscribers in east Asia have complained that download times for the audio files have been slow and time consuming. This was because we had all of our content stored and distributed on North American servers making connections slow for international users. However, we have completely reworked our infrastructure and made use of a Global Content Distribution Network which will ensure faster download times and easier access for people in the US or anywhere else in the world.

### Gifts and Content for Monthly Partners

For those that choose to become a [monthly supporter](/donate "Learn about becoming a SOGMI supporter") of SOGMI we will begin to periodically send gifts, such as t-shirts, or teachings, as well as invitations to specific events. We are also looking to start having regular livestream sessions with our partners where they can submit questions and more. 

## Closing Thoughts
In Luke 12:48 it says “…From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.” God has already given us so much. Accordingly, we will rise to the challenge and be faithful with what has been given to us. God truly is raising the standard, but it’s exciting since it means that even greater things are ahead of us. Let’s go after the call that has for us!
