Right before our very eyes, we are seeing prophecies fulfilled! We are truly in the most exciting time in the history of the Church and in the history of the United States of America!

It is my opinion that the most misunderstood, misused and abused gift in this day is the office of the prophet and the gift of prophecy. That is why, this ministry decided to offer prophetic school and do write ups about prophets and prophecy to educate, inspire, instruct, and train the body of Christ.

I realized that what the Body of Christ needs right now is clear understanding and revelation about the modern day prophets and prophecies released, which are manifesting before our very eyes.

For several years now, the apostles and prophets have taken the center stage to build and to mature the Body of Christ to receive her inheritance; to understand and know who she is in Christ Jesus. 

> “Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone.” - Ephesians 2:19-20 (NIV)

## Why is the office of the prophet or prophecies essential in our day?

Prophetic words are creative words: they create things and call those things as though they were. Prophecies also accelerate time, which ordinarily can take too long, cost too much or is, too difficult to attain, if not impossible.

For example, the economic recovery of a given nation takes an average of 10 years to turn around. It is kind of expected. That is the way of the world, which operates under the natural law, economic law, etc. But not in the ways of God, not in the kingdom of our God. In the world’s point of view, if it is too good to be true then , more than likely it is not! In the kingdom of our God, if it’s too good to be true then it is supernatural, it is the way of God.

> “Some time later, Ben Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria. There was a greate famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.
The whole nation was such in a great distress because of the siege and they resorted to cannibalism.” - 2 Kings 6:24-25 (NIV)

God used a prophet to turn the economy of the whole nation around within twenty-four hours. Here is the prophecy:

> “Elisha said, ‘Here the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.” – 2 Kings 7:1 (NIV)

It is like saying in our modern time that within 24 hours the gas prices in the United States of America will sell for ten cents a gallon and Diesel for 20 cents a gallon all across the country. This is how supernatural prophetic words are. (Hebrews 4:12)

Now, the supernatural results happen in supernatural ways. God used four men with leprosy who were talking outside of the city gate. They were at the bottom of the food chain and they decided to surrender to their enemies. If they were spared, they would live for another day but if they were killed, they were going to die anyway!

> “When they reached the Aramean camp they did not find anyone there because the Lord caused the four lepers’ footsteps to sound to the Arameans like sounds of chariots and horses and a great army. So they abandoned their camp leaving all the tents, gold, silver, and weapons.” – 2 Kings 7:4-6 (NIV)

The four lepers informed the king of what happened so within 24 hours, the economy of the whole nation turned around in as prophesied. This is the way of God and this is why prophecies are important in our days.

## Prophecy Can Turn Around Your Situation

What are you dealing with right now? How impossible is the situation you are facing or you have been waiting to make happen? You need a “thus sayeth the Lord” to create and/or accelerate the manifestation of things in your life. You just have to follow your instruction to the letter, be consistent, and look upon who God is. 

In the Books of Acts, the apostles did not have to raise funds or even ask for offerings. Their disciples and the people where moved by the Holy Spirit to give. It started with one man named Joseph (Barnabas) who sold a piece of his property and laid the proceeds of sale at the apostles’ feet and others follow suit. There was no one in need among the disciples (Acts 4:34-37).

Jesus multiplied loaves and fishes and fed thousands of people by breaking few loaves of bread into small pieces and lo and behold there were twelve baskets full of leftovers! He expects us to do greater things in our days. Once we receive instruction from the Lord, we need to spring into action and do what we can do for that specific time. Do not wait for favorable conditions before you move. The just shall live by faith (Habakkuk 2:4, Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38).

The ways of our God are miraculous and will turn around our situation and deliver us by us just following simple instructions. His ways and heart is to manifest and put us where we should be in His kingdom through personal prophecies. We need to believe, trust, and obey His instruction (to the letter) with any given prophecy.

## The Influence Prophecy Has Had In My Life

I will never forget it when I received my first prophecy. It was astounding and awesome and some people who heard it got offended. I was new in the kingdom of God. My prophecy was that I would travel all over the world, discipling His people and that I would prophesy and minister to the kings of the earth and be treated like royalty. When Mike and I got married, that prophecy was released by the Holy Spirit out of the mouth of his four prophets. It was too good to be true at that time, but my spirit received it and bore witness to that prophecy. Now, that prophecy is being fulfilled. I have ministered and prophesied to world leaders, to leaders of nations, and I have traveled all over the world. If your prophecy is too good to be true, it is from God! That specific prophecy is too good to be true, it is from God! That specific prophecy I received were creative words from the Lord Jesus Christ and they continue to come to pass! Glory to God!

## Moving Forward

Prophets will lead the way in the things of God; they will promote and give all the glory to God and they will obey Him and put Him front and center. If you are called in the prophetic, it is time for you to study and get discipled by a prophet or prophets of God. The Lord has a need of you in these last days!

It is time for your great destiny to be fulfilled and your inheritance in Christ Jesus manifest! 
Even so, come Lord Jesus!
