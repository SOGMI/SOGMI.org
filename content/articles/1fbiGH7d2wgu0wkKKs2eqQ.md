In 1991, I was caught in a dream-like vision. In this encounter with God, He handed me a formula on how to find His kingdom. It was a series of very detailed instructions He expected me to follow. He told me that He would be sending laborers who would follow my lead, knowing fully well that they would find the kingdom. These people were matured and did not desire material things. In this vision, we set out to find the kingdom of God and stopped in the middle of a forest. Our instruction was to dig. As soon as the team started digging (I now know that this means studying the Word of God deeper), gold coins started coming out. The deeper we dug, the more coins we found, and soon, there was more gold than soil. We piled up a huge heap of gold, and the team continued digging. I picked up a round object from the pile of dirt and started cleaning it with a cloth. I discovered that it was a gold necklace. Suddenly God showed up, taking the gold from my hand and examining it very carefully. He went on to tell me that it was only half of a necklace, and we needed to continue searching for the other half. Then, He disappeared. I have been pondering this encounter since 1991.

I now know that it is really the will of God for His people to prosper, and the deeper our relationship with God, the more blessings will come without toil. A few months after this encounter, in May 1991, the Lord took me to the heavenlies and gave me specific instructions that pertain to our present time. He emphasized to me at that time that I was being sent back to earth for the greater work: to preach to whomever will listen that His Son Jesus Christ is coming very, very soon. Body of Christ, these are the greater works.

__Receive the prosperity message from God in our time.__ Let us be the generation in which the transfer of wealth will be truly manifested. We need the resources to preach the Gospel all over the world; without compromise, and without having to submit or give in to begging for money through programs causing and teaching the people of God to succumb to emotional giving. We need to occupy and take over the marketplace as it covers almost 80% of the harvest of souls.

There is no doubt in our hearts that God wants to empower His people to gain wealth (Deuteronomy 8:18) at this hour and at this time. This is the good news of the Gospel of our times. We should not be occupying ourselves in the doom and gloom economics of our time-- we are not part of the economic system of the world. The same way that we follow God's word and His instructions in our lives and ministry must also be the same way that we follow business practices; it has to be God's way. The same way we teach prophetic school (discipline and strict adherence to the Word of God) must also be the same way that we apply God's Word in the corporate arena.

We will open the opportunity for everyone to learn God's Business Plan for our times through our website. You must register online to be a part of this school. Let us join hands together, occupy (until He comes) the marketplace for His glory, to usher forth His coming and to save the lost souls from eternal damnation.

If we carefully follow God's way of doing things, we will have great success (Joshua 1:7-8). The only qualifications for this transfer of wealth are these:

1. Believe in the Lordship of Jesus Christ in all areas of your life including your business/work. 
2. Have faith (worketh by love) that God called you to prosper and determine in your heart to give Him all the glory. 
3. Follow His Word (instruction specifically how to conduct your business affairs) carefully. 
4. Meditate on this day and night.

Welcome to the Business School of the Holy Spirit! This is not just a lifestyle; it is a spiritual adventure with Christ on earth.
