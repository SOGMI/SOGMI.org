## 1) Take inventory of your life
To partake in the transfer of wealth you need to examine your life and take a look at everything. __Anything that is not from God, you need to reject it__.

God expects every area of our life to be in line with His ways of doing things. We cannot afford compromises in any area. This includes your businesses, relationships, partnerships, and more - not a single area is exempt.

> Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
> 
> Romans 12:1-2 (NIV)

## 2) Manifestations must affirm / reaffirm God's purpose in blessing you

When a blessing comes or even if you are believing for something, you need to ask yourself the following: “Is the purpose of God manifesting in this?” Any manifestation in your life has to meet this criteria. It has to give God glory. It has to benefit His people, and it has to benefit you. All of God's blessings will meet this criteria.

A good example of this is the call of Abraham in Genesis 12:

> The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.
> 
> “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”
>
> Genesis 12:1-3 (NIV)

## 3) Be wary of manifestations that only satisfy your cravings / desires.

This principle is connected to the previous one. If you are the only person benefiting from a blessing, then it's not from God. If the blessing is only working to satisfy your own desires then it's not from God. God will always get the glory and it will benefit you and others, just like when God blessed Abraham.

## 4) Do everything you can do.

Do everything you are able to do, and if there are any impossible tasks, ask God for His intervention. In addition to this, whatever your gift is, that is what you should be doing. God did not give you your gifts for them to sit idly gathering dust. You should ask God how to start using the gifts He’s given you (without neglecting your current responsibilities). If you are unsure of your calling this principle is a good starting point. Start using what God has already given you.

Remember the Parable of the Talents (also known as the Parable of the Bags of Gold) in Matthew chapter 25. In this parable, Jesus said "the Kingdom of heaven is like this..." and he tells a story of a man leaving his servants an allotment of gold. To one servant he gave five bags, to another two bags, and to another one bag. In the story, the man expects each of his servants to take what was given them and produce more with it. God is expecting the same with us. Whatever He has given you, you are expected to produce results with it.

## 5) Apply the Golden Rule

> “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.” (NIV)
> 
> Matthew 7:12

## 6) Keep improving in every area

Work on improving every area of your life. Talk to God about your abilities and gifts and how you can improve them.

> "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
>
> Luke 16:10 (NIV)

## 7) Expect something to happen

When you follow instructions God is always faithful to manifest His promises. We should act as if we expect God to move.

## 8) Don’t leave any messes

When God gives us an assignment or project we should not leave a mess being. We need to finish our projects completely and clean up all the areas affected by that project. The areas that we work in should not be messier than before we started working. Someone else should not have to come in and clean up after us.

## 9) Increase the value of what you have

Anything you have, you need to work to increase its value. If you cannot increase the value of what you have now, how can you be trusted to turn thousands into millions? Or millions into billions? This principle is in alignment with the Parable of the Talents mentioned earlier. The servants were expected to multiply the gold that was given to them. In the same way, God expects us to increase the value of what we have now.
