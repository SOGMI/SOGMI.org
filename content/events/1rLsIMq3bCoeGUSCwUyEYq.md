Come join us for the 2019 Prophetic Gathering of the Saints here in San Antonio, TX, where we gather together as a Body to celebrate all the Lord has done, and will do in the new year. We model this event after the verse in Exodus 23:16, when God's people gather in all the increase the Lord has provided through their fields - and what an increase we've seen across the nation in 2018!

Let us praise God corporately for His outpouring, and pray together as one Body as we enter 2019. Pastor Cristina Sosso will take the time to share prophetic words, for the nations, the Body of Christ, and for you individually as well!

God is doing a great and marvelous work in the Body of Christ today and we are undoubtedly on the cusp of history in the making. Let this be a time to strengthen your faith and personal ministry for the glory of the Lord!

Register today to reserve your spot! Seating is limited. Please dress in church attire.

Event will be recorded.
