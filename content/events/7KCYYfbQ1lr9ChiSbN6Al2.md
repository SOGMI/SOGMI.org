Celebrate God with us this Pentecost. We will be holding an outdoor celebration service in the Freedom Fellowship Church International parking lot. A large tent will be setup to keep us cool while we praise and honor God. We also encourage those who are sick or need a breakthrough are encouraged to attend as a portion of the service will be dedicated to laying hands on the sick to watch God perform many miracles.
