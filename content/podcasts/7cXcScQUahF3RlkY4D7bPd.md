description: "We must get out of our own ambition, expectations, and desires and be kingdom minded. Our obedience and the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ is the most prized pearl that we could acquire. Let us not get distracted by our \"own ministry\" or what we think is important. Let us always consider the heart of God, because He will always consider yours."
