god bless you for tuning in hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom Fellowship charts and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time what a time the body of Christ is entering into what a time we're having and since at freedom fellowship charts and sons of God ministries which is in other parts of the world to the prophecies are manifesting and many of them manifested already and we are so excited we're so excited and at the same time very grateful on what God is doing to the body of Christ and just like I addressed last week about the heart issue when we believe our prophecy when we receive when we get prophesied on and it's awesome all prophecies from God they're good because you know what even their Corrections if you repented and if you made the correction you'll be restored you are forgiven automatically by God because He loves you now if some of you I hope only a handful are wondering how come you're not seeing things you're not experiencing this move of God your prophecies are not manifesting how come you believe God you're not compromising you're not sinning in other words and it's still not manifesting then we need to check our agape walk it might be a heart issue more than likely it is a heart issue that sometimes because we are so conditioned to follow the Babylonian system even though we specialize it sometimes we don't know why as if we are in cycles we're in cycles all the time and yet some Christians are not they're continued to move forward so if you're wondering if you're one of those that's wondering how come you're not part of the blessings you're not receiving the blessings from God or your prophecies are not manifesting let us check our heart issue last week I discussed about the parable of the prodigal son in Luke chapter 15 verse 11 through 31 we all know the story right the the younger son went to his father and asked for his inheritance so the father divided the inheritance between the two sons and the younger brother went squandered his money on prostitutes and he lost everything and he was starving so he decided to beg to come back and begged for his father's forgiveness and also to ask if he can be hired as one of his servants instead the father welcomed him with open arms and the older brother once he found out about it he got angry so the older brother in that parable also had a heart issue why the scripture is very clear when Jesus shared his parable the father shared equally the inheritance shared equally so whatever the father spent towards this prodigal son when he came back it didn't come out from the other sons inheritance it has nothing to do with his inheritance it has something to do with the other son but he didn't care about his father missing his other son he didn't care that his father was brokenhearted he didn't care that he lost his brother he only cared about himself about what he deserved I wanted to keep that in mind this time of restoration and healing we need to rejoice over those who came back to the we need to pray for them we need to encourage them to let go of the past and press on towards the marks of the high calling in Christ Jesus we have to rejoice with our brothers and sisters when their dreams come true even though yours have not manifested yet if there's that manifested yours is next just don't get into Envy malice or don't give in to offenses right and Luke chapter 15 verse 28 it says the older brother was angry and wouldn't go in his father came out and begged him look at that because the Father loved them both but he had him all these times but the son he almost lost him so he was overjoyed but the older son cannot rejoice with his father in our times no matter what we're dealing with if you're fighting jealousy fighting envy or even bitterness because of the victory or the blessings of others let us consider the heart of our Father God let us consider him first and then if we consider his heart if we go after his own heart then we will all make the right correction and adjustment as far as our attitudes are concerned about our heart issue right so in verse 29 the son replied all these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to and all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends yet when this son of yours come back after squandering your money on prostitutes you celebrate by killing the fattened calf his father said to him look there son you have always stayed by me and everything I have is yours we had to celebrate this happy day for your brother was dead and has come back to life he was lost but now he's found the father divided the inheritance equally and when the younger son came back the father did not take away anything from the older<split> sons inheritance it has nothing to do with him when our brothers and sisters dreams come true don't be resentful of them because by your option and by your bitter words you're saying that our God is not just that he plays fabrics do not be resentful of the fact that our God is generous and ever loving and merciful you know I'll show you one example we started the holding miracle crusade here in Texas in 2003 and we go everywhere where God sent us to and we've held miracle Crusades well in one of the miracle Crusades here in San Antonio God moved and touch everyone that came there was a young woman who was so blessed she wanted to bless me but she didn't have any money so she left and while driving home she was still thanking God about the crusade and she mentioned again that she really wanted to bless me the Holy Spirit told her yes you have a seed you have something to bless her and she was directed to sew the pearl necklace she just made to me she makes jewelry she makes them in Seldon so see turn around she was so excited but I was still ministering to people so si went and approached Erica who was about 8 years old at that time my daughter and she told Erica to give that necklace to me one woman in the group one woman at UH was a part of freedom faucet charts at that time saw and heard what this woman told Erica and saw the pearl necklace she didn't like it see you went to Erica and took the pearls from my daughter and drop it at the offering basket she told Erica this is an offering so it needs to be in this offering basket so my daughter I didn't say anything but the woman who gave me those necklace saw everything and came back and retrieved the necklace again and this time she waited for me so she explained to me how much she got blessed after I finished done ministering she came to me and told me how blessed she was it was her first time in that she wanted to personally hand me the pearl necklace an instruction to God but the other woman took it from Erica so she specifically told me again that I want to sow that seed personally to you I thanked her and the Holy Spirit told me to be mindful of that seed so I took the necklace and place it next to my purse in my Bible so after I finished I was getting ready to go back to my room I look for the necklace and the same woman told me that she took the necklace because it's an offering and place it in the offering basket because they're real pearls why did she do that she resented the fact that people are giving me gifts she resented the fact that she wanted that necklace for herself but with the instruction from the Holy Spirit I did not give that necklace to her so I took the necklace and I told her next time please don't do that if somebody really ask somebody to give and said they're mindful of their seed and so don't you do that and kept on telling me that I already have pearl necklace and those are real pearls well yeah so I finally asked the lady what is it to you what is your problem that is not your seed it is somebody else's seed so I took the necklace back and I wore it right there and then after a few weeks that woman was gone glory to God see she didn't spend any money on that necklace I did not ask for that necklace but somebody wanted to be generous and sow a seed to me personally as they resented it and she did not check her heart issue if she did she could be traveling with me right now she could have been getting blessings from others at the same time but see missed opportunities because instead of rejoicing in the blessings of others she resented it because in her heart she needed the money she needed those necklace more than I do when probably's is right but I have to follow the instruction from the Lord I don't give away presents from others until the Lord releases me to give them away so did you get passed on for promotion again you can cry but keep in mind that our God is just it is a heart issue in proverbs 4:23 says above all else guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life Roberts 2412 if you say but we knew nothing about this that's not he who wastes the heart perceive it that's not he who guards your life no it will he not repay it's person according to what he has done God is watching you cannot get rid of him because he's everywhere so when this resentment comes when this bitterness comes unforgiveness jealousy envy those are natural tendencies that you and I have to fight and overcome every day we need to ask the Holy Spirit to help us cleanse our hearts to teach us how to be a man after God's own heart and above all else always consider the heart of our loving God we belong to him you know what your prophecies are manifesting right now to you my brother and sisters who are thinking that there is no chance for you you know in your<split> situation brother you're not listening by accident your situation how impossible it is no you're not going to jail God is going to intervene on your behalf he loves you and he knows you love him too and now he's leading you to the path where you should be there will be restoration and keep in mind my dear sister you don't need to earn the love of a father you're already approved you have a loving father in him he is all that you need so stop looking for love the wrong places from the wrong people God is going to cut those influences and those relationships that are not from him because he loves you and yes there is a greater future for you you're beautiful you're approved you're qualified and there's nothing that you can do that will separate you from his love he will never give up on you and when he was on the cross he looked at you in your present situation and try to imagine him looking at your eyes right now and telling you you know what you are worth dying for that's how important you are in the kingdom so stand strong receive the forgiveness and the cleansing loving God okay don't worry about the things that you cannot do focus on the little things that you can all you need to do is to call on him okay you saying Jesus Jesus my Lord and my Savior I accept you and thank you for accepting me as one of your own and tell him that you want to be born again and the Holy Spirit will come to you and the heavens will rejoice and they will act like the father in the prodigal son acted he didn't punish the younger son he did not even reprimand him he embraced him changed his clothes and prepare a feast that is what a loving father wants to do with you right now to hold you to love you to restore you and reassure you that you are loved okay okay so it's about a heart issue and I'm going to get one more thing this is also time for when the harvest is coming it's time to pull the weeds to in order to prepare for the next crop to be planted right so I'm talking about the parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke chapter 10 verse 25 and this is something that will be so interesting with you and I'm going to try to make things fast because I'm running out of time in Luke chapter 10 25 says one day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question teacher what should I do to inherit eternal life jesus replied what does the law of Moses say how do you read it the man answered you must love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul and all your strength and all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself see that is a heart issue love the Lord and love your neighbor as yourself okay a lot of times for me especially for me before I got the revelation of this parable it's easy to love God but sometimes it's very challenging to love your neighbor as you love yourself I'm just being honest until I got the revelation of this parable okay so it's not going to be difficult for you to to love your neighbors in verse 28 says right Jesus told him do this and you will live the men wanted to justify his actions because he was testing Jesus so he asked Jesus and who is my neighbor here it is in verse 30 jesus replied with a story a Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho and he was attacked by bandits they stripped him of his clothes beat him up and left him half dead beside the road by chance a priest came along but when he saw the men lying there he crossed to the other side of the road and passed him by a temple assistant walked over and looked at him lying there but he also passed by on the other side if you're going to look at this parable right now the priest we can call him a pastor right now a temple assistant and elder up a charts a lay minister maybe they're anointed right okay verse 33 then a despised Samaritan came along and when he saw the man he felt compassion for him going over to him the Samaritan soothe his wounds with olive oil and wine and wound and bandaged them then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an end where he took care of him the next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins telling him take care of the spin if his bill runs higher than this I'll pay you the next time I'm here now which of this three would you say was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by bandits Jesus asked the man replied the one who showed him mercy then Jesus said yes now go and do the same the Jewish man who was attacked his neighbor was the Samaritan this is from Jesus okay so Jesus commanded us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves this is the second great commandment and jesus defined who our neighbors are just like for this Jewish man was attacked his neighbor was the Samaritan and what did Jesus tell us we have to follow these two Commandments right to love God and<split> to love our neighbors then Jesus said yes now go and do the same if you're going to do this you will live that's what Jesus said if you love your neighbors I should love yourself so Jesus defined who our neighbors are not the unknowing that priests who ignore the man lying on the road not the temple assistant who passed the injured man and went on the other side those are not our neighbors that were supposed to love ourselves so are recommended by God to love this - were not operating in love yes to forgive them and not to be like them but we should love our neighbors those who have what helped us along the way those who discipled us those who loved us those who took care of us and not just ignored us because Jesus commanded his disciples to do the same not just to be a good Samaritan because we always focus on the Good Samaritan but this came out because of the heart issue of this man who was testing Jesus about how can I live how can I have an eternal life it's about the two Great Commandment so our neighbors those who have the heart those who are merciful those that are shown mercy those who have invested their time for us those who lend a helping hand in time of need those who took pity those that were merciful those are our neighbors so now it's not too difficult to love our neighbors as we love ourselves you look and read this parable again so that you will have a deeper understanding on who our neighbors are okay so I'll just leave you that keep in mind it is always a hard issue in the kingdom of God is always about the heart it is the heart that God searches every time for the eyes of the Lord reigns throughout the earth seeking to the strengths and those whose hearts are pure before him 2nd chronicles 19 and 6 and you do the same and I'm running out of time thank you and join us in our Sunday services mark your calendar for December 31st 2016 for the annual prophetic gathering of the Saints in San Antonio Texas you need to register for that event and also I am going to the Philippines in

schools everywhere I go and people are lining up right now it's not a matter of where do I get an invitation it's a matter which one and where to go so continue to pray for me and sow a seed it's a great seed
