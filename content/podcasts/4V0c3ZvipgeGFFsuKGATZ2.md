description: "You must make God sovereign in everything you do. That means focusing on where God is leading you and treating His Word as a lighthouse leading you through the storm. Only those that are able to fully commit to God are going to be used mightily. If you don't consult the Holy Spirit now, you won't when you have influence and success. We cannot afford to make assumptions, let us always consult the Holy Spirit."
