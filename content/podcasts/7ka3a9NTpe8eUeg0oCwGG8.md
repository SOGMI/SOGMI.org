description: "Ephesians 2:19 says, ‘We are no longer foreigners and aliens, but we are now members of the household of God. Our citizenship is in Heaven.’ So if God wants to talk to you, He would rather talk directly to you, face to face instead of through someone else... That is His preference, He wants to personally attend to you. He communicates in that still small voice in your heart and in your mind and He is going to lead you towards maturity. He says that from the least to the greatest of us we will all know Him… God loves you and that is what is the matter. You need to communicate with Him.\n"
