description: "Our experiences with God should be regularly transforming us. If you haven't been receiving new revelations, it means you haven't been making room for the Holy Spirit to transform you. We cannot allow ourselves to get stuck in our habits and old ways of thinking. God is calling us to do things we cannot do on our own, so we must allow the Spirit of God to equip and empower us."
