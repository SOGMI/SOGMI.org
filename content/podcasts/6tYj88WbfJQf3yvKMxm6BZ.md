description: "God is positioning the nations all over the world. It is His anointing that shall break the yokes. So, we must continue to pray for the wicked; we must continue to consider the heart of God; we must intercede and pray instead of being eager to release prophecies of judgment. Do not grieve God with your own judgments, assumptions and words. Let God deal with the wicked. If the Body of Christ remains steadfast and obedient, keeping Jesus front and center, we will see this country turn towards righteousness and we will have a righteous government."
