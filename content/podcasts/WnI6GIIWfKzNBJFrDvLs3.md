description: "As we spend time with God and obey the greatest commandment we will hear His voice more and more. Let us remember that God will always take care of us as we go about doing His work, so let us remain focused and not worry ourselves! Continue to consecrate yourself and allow God to guide you. Let us place our trust in Him."
