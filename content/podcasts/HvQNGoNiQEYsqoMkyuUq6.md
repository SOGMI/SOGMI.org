description: "When I became a young Christian, one of the Bible passages that I loved so much is in Psalm 37. Psalm 37:5 Commit your ways unto the Lord. Trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. That’s a passage that I’ve held on to up to this day. That as long as I commit what I want to do into the hand of God, as long as I allow God to lead and direct me, there may be problems, there will definitely be challenges because the enemy does not want you to achieve that so that God will not be glorified in your life. But at the same time, hold on to your commitment, and the plan and purpose of God will be fulfilled."
