description: "We must decide within ourselves to obey God and completely submit to Him and trust Him. God does not take us out of challenges, but He will be with us through them. He will not give you all of the details at the time; did he with David when he was still tending the sheep, or with Joseph when he was sold into slavery? The path He has put us on will prepare us for what we are supposed to do, we just need to submit ourselves to Him and trust Him. Get with God, for it is not too late for you to catch the next train."
