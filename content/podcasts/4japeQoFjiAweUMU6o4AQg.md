god bless you for tuning in hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom fellowship church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time what a wonderful God we serve changes changes changes are coming and many wonderful things the church is really emerging as a glorious church and it means you included so get your hearts right let's get a new mindset and let's begin just for you our radio listeners you are a part of our Sunday evening service and I just wanted to remind you to register for the prophetic conference on September 29th and 30th seating is limited how do you register you can go to our website is's if we receive the things that we have been praying and believing God for the prophetic words that God has released upon your life is going to come to pass because the best way not the only way the best way to get the attention of the backsliding Christians and even unbelievers is through signs and wonders and once it manifested in your life then you know you can give it away no one can talk you out of it and when you know when your partakers of God's miracles and grace you have the anointing or the confidence or the authority to share this to others okay and I'm going to show in the Bible that in this time that we're in the greatness of the season that we're in new revelation will come through wisdom vision word of knowledge right with our exact and you got people's attention through the word of knowledge I know from my own experience when you prophesy to people you get their attention especially when you give them a word of knowledge that they know and they know that only God can reveal those to a person and you know that God is in it and it will change you you will pay attention when somebody you receive a word of knowledge so this is what's happening in our days remember I shared with you how God is beginning to let me see visions and he's talking to me again in dreams numerous times almost every night I love to go to sleep now so that I know I'm going to hear from him and then at the same time he talks to me face to face well God doesn't talk to you that way that's reasons why you take a listen because of the fact that God can really talk to you face to face and God is funny he's not thou art holy he is holy right but he is not that proper stiff person and I'm going to show to you in the Bible the effectiveness of the word of knowledge okay so we're going to talk about Jesus since the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy without him it's false prophets okay let's go to John chapter 1 starting with verse 35 the next day John was there again with two of his disciples when he saw Jesus passing by he said look the Lamb of God a prophet confirming that Jesus is the Lamb of God a well-known anointed prophet right when the two disciples heard him say this they followed Jesus now let's go down to verse 40 Andrew simon Peters brother was one of the two heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus the first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him we have found the Messiah that is the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and here it is Jesus looked at him meaning Peter and said you are Simon son of John you will be called Cephas which was translated to Peter so Jesus looked at him and gave him a word of knowledge you are Simon son of John and you will be called Cephas it's a word of knowledge and a prophecy for the future in the future you will not be called Simon you'll be called Peter but he identified him that got Peter as a god oh this must be the Messiah really because he knows right and this is what's going to happen it's going to manifest in our lifetime because Jesus expects us to do greater things and he did and remember we are now operating in the priesthood of Melchisedec right okay verse 43 the next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee finding Philip he said to him follow me and he did verse 44 Philip liked Andrew and Peter was from the town of Bethsaida Philip found Nathanael and told him we have found the one Moses wrote about in the law and about whom the prophets also wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph so Philip is telling his friend best friend or buddy Nathanael come on we have found the Messiah his name is Jesus and he's the son of Joseph right okay verse 46 I said Nazareth can anything good come from there Nathanael asked Nathanael was what<split> prejudice snooty elitist am I correct oh no I'm not going to live in the south side of San Antonio I'm going to live in the Dominion because this is where I belong you live where right can anything good come from Nazareth come and see said Philip when Jesus saw Nathanael approaching he said to him here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit said how do you know me Nathanael asked jesus answered I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you then a time you declared rabbi you are the son of God you are the king of Israel what chains word of knowledge right because if I were to be Jesus if I'm not saved and I'm prophet I'll say like yeah and you told me this and said you were so snooty you say that there's nothing good that will come out of Nazareth right but Jesus no Jesus only so what the Holy Spirit showed him a vision of who Nathaniel is same thing with us with all of our prejudices we'll all of our shortcomings we'll all of our weaknesses and shortcomings Jesus is not looking at those he's looking at you and your destiny who you truly are here's a man who who don't know any deceit and here is he was nudey Jesus overlooked all of those because that's the world's way and here he is he is being led by the Holy Spirit are you getting this and things got changed because of that so now the fan you'll not only believe I guarantee you you stop saying those things o Nazareth oh that's a good tongue that's where the Messiah is staying that's a good good Town Oh Southside oh good tongue right I see that when I move their development and blessings and progress will follow me and that's who we are we don't look at that challenges we look at the outcome and the ending result God wants the glory and we get the goods right and we can tell others that's worth knowledge I remember when Deb and Esther and Dora because I was crying to the Lord I was fighting discouragement you spend a lot of time the cycling people they got offended and then they leave and then new ones come in and then they leave for one some reasons or another and I was discouraged I thought the Lord and said where do I fail I said like what do I need to do and this is like this people and they've been saying this about you and they be giving your challenges and said and you want to keep them well I thought that's being a Christian am I correct but then it's just like well and said they're yours they're not mine anyway so but I'm still I said god I'm still a little bit depressed and said like no and this is like I'm sending you and he told me three women and Kobe they were finding excuse after excuse to really leave and go as far as they can but what got their attention the word of knowledge got people's attention how did I break into the mode of all the stumbling blocks that people put before me signs and wonders word of knowledge and sometimes they really think that I know everything and sometimes they're scared they're scared of me but they're drawn to the prophetic because God sent each and every one of you but it's a word of knowledge because once everything that we are holding dear everything that were focused when we're comfortable we already cross our T's and put the dots on our eyes that we have and get our doctrine situated and all of a sudden and we are obeying everything right okay we have to get a confession of dears or when the name and claim it came about everybody's is doing things and then when God gives you a revelation or a word of knowledge that is just totally totally out of your doctrine as long it comes from Jesus God is up to something big to transform your life and those that you touch okay so it is important for this time not to get comfortable on where you're at you cannot be comfortable with the anointing anyway so much more with the word of knowledge is very exact and it is coming now because it is coming it's starting in 2017 the word of knowledge will come back in such a big way in such an anointed way that you don't have any doubts that before you speak and go after shadows not anymore because God is going to give you an exact because he expects us in 2017 for the church to come up as a glorious church okay that's why prophecy prophets and apostles are taking center stage just like in the book of Acts okay and we pastors we better go along with it or get swept away because we pastors we're not the leader of the five offices hello we're not even in the scriptures it is the Apostles and the prophets that build the church hello so everyone has to endeavor that's why the Word of God says that do not despise prophecy but desire that gift do not treat prophecy with contempt right so if somebody will tell one said well they're gone and away with ants it's like we have not emerged as a glorious Church yet<split> and it's not their decision whether it is it's gone and over with because the Apostle Paul is trying to tell them that love is the ultimate thing that you need to guard your heart even if you can sing like an angel if you have not loved you're nothing right he is telling us that loving God and loving his people is the ultimate is the ultimate much better than if you're operating in all the gifts but you are not a very lovable person right okay so it is important for us to understand that God is expecting us so this week with all of your prayer requests and for those of you that are listening on the radio get your prayer requests to God in everything but afterwards you start thanking him and don't ask or pray or ask others to pray for you again right and that is why God now his plan and his intent starting today the things in area of your life that you need deliverance or miracles that he is going to to manifest them if you dare to believe okay that is the only requirement and if you hear his voice don't harden your hearts because the instruction you expect like naman in 2nd Kings chapter 5 naman wanted a difficult assignment to earn his healing from leprosy right some of us the instruction is so easy that we want something harder because our mindset is we have to earn it instead of thinking God for it it is a gift gift is free a gift of life and abundantly is free you don't have to pay for it am i correct it is a gift so it is important for us to understand that so visions are coming dreams are coming and if you have not gotten dreams I started having them in series and series is starting this year but man this summer especially August beginning of August it's everyday sometimes the whole night and then it's just like okay Lord and said could you give me the explanations of this and why are you returning this again and said go back to my gospel how did this all came about so I read this again in John and it is like oh you operated in the word of knowledge just like the woman at the well she became a believer an instant evangelist because Jesus told her how many husbands she had and this is like I said you are a prophet so when he said that I am the Messiah she believed because no one no one can prophesy a word of knowledge like that other than God hello okay and here's another one and your deliverance is going to blessed nations God he wants his glory right now in your life that's why he's making things very exact and very supernatural okay okay so we talked about Nathaniel now let's go to Acts chapter 10 verse 1 starting with verse 1 are you getting this okay at Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius a Centurion in what was known as the Italian regiment means to say he's a Gentile he and all his family were devout and god-fearing he gave generously to those in need and pray to God regularly those are characteristics he prayed and he gave right one day at about 3:00 in the afternoon he had a vision he distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him and said Cornelius Cornelius stared of him in fear what is it Lord he asked why is it so fearful because angels are overwhelmingly huge powerful and intimidating not cute little kids with a curly hair and no underwear those are not angels I don't know why they always make angels that are that are naked their behind is always showing they always have a curly hair and so no they're very intimidating that's why Cornelia and this is an addition an angel appeared to him in a vision not even personal like what is it Lord because he was fearful because they're not cute okay the angel answered your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God here is the instruction this is so easy just like your instruction now just like right now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter that's a word of knowledge right he is staying with Simon the tenor whose house is by the sea when the angel who spoke to him had gone Cornelius called two of his servants in a devout soldier who was one of his attendants not only he sent his servants he also send what somebody a bodyguard for the men of God right he told him everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa a Gentile named Cornelius saw a vision and received instruction from God through an angel and his life his family and his destiny and the destiny of the entire Gentile nations got redirected got chains for all eternity hello for all eternity that's the plan of God right same thing with you and God has a plan and into perfection it's flawless every minor details that perfect timing his perfect timing is impeccable a lot of times especially for me want him to be early right those last few days exact time off standing in faith those are the ones that are the longest right but we know<split> that his perfect is flawless the timing so Acts chapter 10 verse 9 it says about noon the following day so it took them day just to go about noon the following day as they were on their journey in approaching the city Peter went up on the roof to pray verse 10 he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance he saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being left down to earth bites four corners it contained all kinds of four-footed animals as well as reptiles and birds then a voice told him get up Peter kill and eat and said surely not Lord Peter replied I have never eaten anything impure or unclean they're not kosher remember the law the voice spoke to him a second time do not call anything impure that God has made clean this happened three times and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven while Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision see you know there's a meaning listen I cannot quite and said where is prophet Daniel when I need him where is Joseph right the man sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate they called out asking of Simon who was known as Peter was staying there while Peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him Simon three men are looking for you and here is God did you see that they're three men looking for you the Holy Spirit did not care to elaborate their Gentiles I said three men are looking for you he allow Peter to calm down I said just go with them because I said them he didn't tell he didn't tell him the details he didn't tell up Peter you know what I'm going to use you this men saw you in a vision he's a Gentile and his household will be the first one to get baptized by the Holy Spirit because it is not just for the Jews alone but it is for everybody God didn't tell him about the plan he just said get up and go with him just like you well but I don't understand God and said you will not understand it just go you'll get an understanding once you fully obey me well that's all the time that we have thank you for tuning in and don't forget to register for the prophetic conference on September 29 and 30th is starting
