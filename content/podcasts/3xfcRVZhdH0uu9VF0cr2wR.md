description: "In this episode, Pastor Cristina discusses the year to come and what to expect. This year will start off with a bang, and will be a year of harvest, turnaround and manifestations for the world as well as the body of Christ. As for us, we must remember that, as far as God is concerned, it's always a matter of the issues of the heart. We must make sure that our hearts are right, and we must continue to focus on His purpose and ways of doing things. God is waiting on us to follow His ways. No one will be able to stop the move of God that is coming upon the face of the earth, so let us be encouraged!"
