am so excited I am NOT cooking I'm not cleaning or decorating for the first time in many many years all I need for this event this year is to prepare and hear from God and figure out what to wear this is so exciting Deborah told me that it's about time to graduate from cooking and doing the work and it's time to pay somebody else to do the work for us I can get used to this I don't have any problem I will submit and yield to that change today we will discuss on who we are in Christ Jesus I will try to simplify things as much as I can so that I can skin you alive without you even noticing it or without you feeling lots of pain we all need a regenerated body regenerated mind and a new heart for these last days Jesus is very clear about the new wineskin we will not be able to contain the blessings and revelations from heaven with our old skin especially stinking thinking and cold uncaring hearts in Matthew chapter 9 verse 17 and 18 it says no one sews a patch on unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch will pull away from the garment making the tear worse neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins if they do the skins will burst the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined no they pour new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved for those of you who just tuned in I just finished reading Matthew 9 chapter 17 and 18 regarding the wine skins see it is my mission today to skin you alive to replace your skin full wrinkles I'm talking about Spritle wrinkles Jesus is coming back for a bride without spots or wrinkles believe me keep on listening and believe me when I say this is better than chemical peel that some of us ladies pay lots of money this is a lot better not only we grow spiritually it also affects our physical body our hearts our minds so this is so exciting I already skinned the congregation of freedom faucet charts for the past several weeks at the pulpit and I continuously provide the core team with night cream for their skin physical not to remove the wrinkles we don't have any wrinkles but to prevent the wrinkles from manifesting there's a big difference so we are going to look good feel good live good do good and be good in 2016 and for myself I started getting aggressive in trying to exercise I develop a dancer size for myself to be healthy Christian living is the most exciting life especially in 2016 don't make any more excuses just keep on moving you need to take care of your physical body to you know keep moving no excuses see something even some of the household chores they're good exercise gardening is a good exercise walking is a perfect exercise dance even you're out upbeat like me it doesn't matter see before this broadcast the Lord already starched me and straightened out my wrinkles to what I'm about to do or to tell you through this radio broadcast he also gave me a new heart in 2016 so my oldest card wounded hearts is gone and got replaced with a new one glory to God shall we begin when we are born again we became creatures our past was gone and all things were made new we became a spiritual being in a body our spirit regenerated but our flesh is still in the process and we need to apply the principles of the<split> kingdom we need to get to know God and be led by the Holy Spirit in order to attain this and who we are in Christ Jesus let us begin with efficent chapter 1 verses 3 all the way to 14 okay efficience chapter 1 verses 3 through 14 it says praise be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the heavenly realm with every spiritual blessings in Christ for he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ in accordance with his pleasure and will to the praise of his glorious grace which has freely given us in the one he loves for those of you that just Union I'm reading efficent chapter 1 verses 3 and I read all the way to verse 6 now verse 7 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of God's grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding and he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in Christ to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head even Christ in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will in order that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be for the praise of his glory and you were also included in Christ when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised Holy Spirit who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession to the praise of his glory we are talking today about who we are in Christ Jesus our identity in Christ Jesus most of it is spelled out in officience chapter 1 starting with verse 3 all the way through 14 this is a chapter in officience that identify who we are in Christ Jesus if you know more about you and the body of Christ read the entire book of Ephesians that's the Bride of Christ so who are we in Christ Jesus so in accordance to official chapter 1 verse 3 through 14 first he chose us before the creation of the world you did not choose god he chose you so you are very special number 2 he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ and we became joint heirs with Christ we became sons of God according to Romans 8:14 those that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and in Galatians chapter 3 it also says that when we are in Christ there are no longer male or female our identity is in Jesus Christ and we are sons with small s if we are led by the Holy Spirit okay number three he blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus don't forget that the blessing is heavenly realms we need to get to know the Word of God we need to stay in the king of God applies principles through the teaching and the leading of the Holy Spirit okay thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven number four we are redeemed by the blood of Jesus all our sins are forgiven so forgive and forget don't hold any grudges on anyone because that's unforgiveness okay it doesn't matter every time you remember the hurt you feel the pain you keep on releasing that person until it doesn't hurt anymore because Jesus is very clear he said you must forgive because if you don't forgive my father in heaven will not forgive you there's no exceptions so don't hold any grudges anymore okay release the people number five he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in Christ number six we are called by God to implement his ways of doing things here on earth to bring heaven down number eight we are marked in Jesus with a seal the Holy Spirit I will try to address some of the points later on what I would like is to try to simplify this as much as I can and to make it easier for you to realize that it's easy to become whom God called you to be it should be as natural as breathing but today I have to skin you alive first so that you can contain it so the prophetic instruction for you today is don't try too hard God through our Lord Jesus Christ already did the impossible he became the sin in our stead and did the hard part that you cannot do by yourself don't try too hard and don't invent programs and ceremonies to get God's attention you are the apple of his eye the people loan to Jesus Christ remember you are a part of the body of Christ he loves you already receive that love example growing up my family my parents and my siblings they call me tests it's a good name it means generous giver of course you know<split> Cristina means a believer and follower of Christ it is also a good name my high school friends call me gold even today my maiden name means gold in English so it is also a good name my co-workers at the bank call me Christine Chrissie Cristina when I got married my husband started calling me Chris now everybody calls me pastor Chris or Kristina except for my high school friends for my family members they still call me Tess when I'm called those names I don't have to try to become Tess Gold Chris Christine Kristina it's Who I am it's like breathing they all know me by those names God also have different names when we address him as Jehovah Jireh we acknowledge him as he is our provider he is also called Yahweh or great I am a Prince of Peace everlasting father it means to say he's going to be our Father forever Almighty God it means to say all power and authority belongs to him Prince of Peace holy God he is all in all in those names same God showing and revealing his many facets and his character and who he is when we were born again we became in Christ a member of the body of Christ it was automatic it was natural for us like breathing we became when we were born again we were infants we were fed milk but now it's time for us to know our responsibilities it's time for us to walk our salvation with fear and trembling it's time for us to know who we are father God because of Christ Jesus became our Father we call him Abba Father so don't try to earn your place in God just become if you are still trying to earn that love you're still in the world system we're not commanded to earn our salvation or to work for it we are commanded to walk it to walk our salvation with fear and trembling now let me quote to you Ephesians chapter 2 verses 19 to 20 it says consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief Cornerstone you are a member of God's household for example the sasso children Joshua James and Erika they belong to our house they belong to our family they are our children so Joshua James and Erika when they come in in our house they just walk in if the door is open they just barge it open no ceremonies or if they have a key then they open the door with a key they don't have to ask our permission they just come in why because they belong to that household it is their household - they don't have to ask permission every time they come to us to talk to us they don't have to check if their clothes are still in their rooms or they don't have to ask permission to eat or drink because they live in that house when they have problems when they have issues or when they just want to talk to me or to Mike there were no ceremonies they just come and ask because why they're part of the family family is a pattern created by God to show the family of God his heavenly pattern so forget about the ceremonies and step-by-step procedures and how to approach the throne of God this is just so Old Testament when I'm in trouble I don't memorize or try to remember or obey what was commanded in Psalm 100 verse 4 and you know what it is right Psalm chapter 100 verse 4 it says enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise we even have a song that I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with praise or I don't sing some 8410 better is one day in your courts and a thousand elsewhere I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than dwell in the tents of the wicked no according to efficience chapter 19 I belong to the household of God so when I'm in trouble I'll run to God I know I don't have to enter or ask permission or knock on the gates I'll just open the door and say I'm a father Holy Father help me or save me or if I can take care of it myself I'll use my authority in Christ Jesus because I belong to him what belongs to Jesus belongs to me because of what he did we became joint heirs with Christ so same thing with my three children they don't sing or dance before me when they're in trouble or they don't sing or dance before Mike when they wanted to see him they will just open the door and come in a lot of times unannounced glory to God we are in the New Covenant my dear brothers and sisters just like my children don't ask permission if they can eat but yes like in the kingdom of God in the sauce of family there are certain parameters there are certain rules that they have to follow and they are given chores they were given certain response abilities so that they learn and they'll become responsible when they're adults you see the scripture is very clear God provides away an answer to our needs or prayers before we even ask like<split> my children the Holy Spirit tells me when they're in need something or they'll tell me and God found fault in the Old Covenant according to Hebrews chapter 8 starting with verse 7 it says for if there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant no place would have been sought for a mother verse 10 this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time declares the Lord I will put my loss in their minds and write them on their hearts I will be their God and they will be my people so let's go down to verse 13 because I'm running out of time by calling this covenant new he has made the first one obsolete and what is obsolete and Ageing will soon disappear so when you enter word of God you need to change your mindset and try to marry the old ways with the new you know the Old Testament from the book of Genesis all the way to Malachi the prophets prophesy about the coming Messiah and Jesus fulfilled that Jesus fulfilled the law right and it shows the character and the plan of our God it's in the book of Genesis God told Abraham through your seed meaning Jesus Christ all the nations of the earth will be blessed so we see the promises of God but as far as the practices are concerned it got changed because God did not want us to be making sacrifices over and over again that we have to have all the ceremonies before we approach him he made us a member of his household so he is approachable 24/7 so don't run away from God even when you make mistakes even when you sin run towards him he is your father you belong to his hold and he will always forgive you when you repent from the heart get to know your benefits and become it is that easy change your mindset don't try to earn his love but receive receive him receive His blessings make him a part of your everyday life and love him back this is oh he wants get to know his ways apply to your everyday life so that he can manifest his blessings to you I'm running out of time again keep in mind just like me and my children we don't need ceremonies just to get to the house because they live there it belongs to them too same thing in the kingdom of God we are made joint heirs with God through Jesus Christ and we are in Christ don't try too hard but do not waste any more time and don't lose any more opportunities that are open for you and are made available to you the Holy Spirit is more than a willing and more than ready to guide you to teach you to lead you in all truth who is Jesus Christ get to know him get to know our Lord Jesus you will know who you are our identity is in Christ Jesus even so come Lord Jesus call me at two one zero six nine five one six three zero or you can email me at sons of God at si TX that are our calm we are in a season of many beginnings let go of the past let go and embrace the new because our future is a lot brighter it's more promising than ever okay join us in our Sunday services we are located at eighty four nineteen Callahan road of IH ten our service in the morning starts at 10:30 and evening service

for us to not just for the Jewish people but for Christians as well Jesus celebrated the Passover before he was arrested and then when he broke the bread he said that when you do this do it in remembrance of me that's the Passover our Catholic brothers and sisters they call it the Last Supper the Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples so we need to celebrate it it is required for us it's an everlasting covenant so god bless you for tuning in until next time
