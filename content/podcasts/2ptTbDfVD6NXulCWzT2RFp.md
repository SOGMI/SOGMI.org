description: "Do not get distracted or concerned with all that is going on in the world and this country, instead focus on what it is you are supposed to do. Focus on the goodness of God and what He is doing. Many good things are happening in spite of the turmoil. Remember that the wicked will continue to do wicked and the righteous will continue to do righteous."
