description: "I have to share today some of the prophecies released for the past 2 weeks. Just keep in mind that the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. That is in Revelation 19:10. We cannot add or take away from The Book of Revelation, and all prophecies are centered towards our Lord Jesus Christ. Just keep that in mind okay. As you may know, for the past two weeks I have been talking to you about false narratives that keep many Christians in the dark on what God is doing on the face of the Earth. We sometimes wondered why our prayers are not being answered and how come we don't hear the voice of God. And because we don't hear the voice of God, many of us concluded that God does not speak to his people anymore. No, God did not lose His voice. He's an almighty God, okay?"
