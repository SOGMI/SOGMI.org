description: "When the Lord calls you to something, it is not going to look easy from the outside, because it will be something greater than what you can do on our own. You must hold fast to the things God has spoken over your life; do not let anyone or anything talk you out of it or plant seeds of doubt. When we step out in faith or unbelief it impacts more than just us, so let us have a positive impact."
