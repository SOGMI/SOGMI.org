description: "We cannot take part in the transfer of wealth and influence if we neglect or disobey the great commissionâ€” it must be our number one priority. We must focus on preaching the gospel of good news and making disciples of all nations. Do not be intimidated by the world and the challenges of our time; remember that God has our backs. We are called to the nations, so we must pray for our leaders and desire that all men be saved; we must intercede on their behalf."
