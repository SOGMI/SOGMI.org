description: "Many great things will happen throughout this summer, and things will increase in their intensity. Many opportunities are open for the Body of Christ because God loves us and He is a God of second chances. However, we have to go through the process of listening, obeying and always operating with the upmost integrity. Let us always do the right thing, forgive and move forward. Let us forsake our ways and follow God and His ways of doing things."
