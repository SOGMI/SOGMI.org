description: "Allow God to prioritize things for you. We cannot lean on our own understandings or let ourselves become distracted with bad news or worries. God will make things clear to you as long as you are attentive to Him. We must continue to look at our own hearts and motivations, and also of prophets' hearts and motivations. Continue to watch your words, for you will have what you say."
