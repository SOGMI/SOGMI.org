description: "Isaiah 43:18-19 “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.”\n\nChanges and more changes are coming. There will be major shakeups, major changes that are good for the body of Christ, and you and I don’t want to miss this. As we are witnessing upheavals, changes, and new revelations or truth or plots being uncovered, it is important for us to be mindful that we are in the middle of the great move of God in the history of the church."
