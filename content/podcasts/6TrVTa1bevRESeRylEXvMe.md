description: "There will come times of difficulty and times when you do not understand; you need to decide for yourself if you will act based on your own understand and fears, or if you will choose to trust and obey the Lord. Unless we are willing to persevere, we will not step into the fullness of what God has for us. The Body of Christ needs to be maturing and equipping each other. We must make sure our motivations are right; Ask yourself if you are doing this for the praises of men, or for the goodness of God. Let us continue to increase the intensity of our faith and obedience."
