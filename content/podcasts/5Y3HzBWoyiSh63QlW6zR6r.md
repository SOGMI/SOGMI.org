description: "We will see replacement, displacement, promotion and demotion in the Body of Christ, then we will see it all over the world. God is replacing the 'Sauls' of our time with the 'Davids'. We must continue to consider the heart of God and remember that He does not enjoy the judgement of the wicked; let us intercede on their behalf. Let us also discipline ourselves to go before the Lord instead of taking things into our own hands and being quick to speak."
