description: "We have so much to be thankful for, and it’s so important to recognize what God has done in our lives. We can look back over a couple of years or months and think, “Wow! Where would I be if not for God? Where would I be now without His mercy, without His goodness?” And so we can always be thankful for that. We’re thankful for all that God has done for us. We’re thankful for all that He’s given us, for all the opportunities that He’s given us. And it’s so important that when God appears in our life, when God begins to reveal Himself to us that we take a hold of Him and we don’t let go."
