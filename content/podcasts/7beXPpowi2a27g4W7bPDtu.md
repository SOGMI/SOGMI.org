description: "In this broadcast Pastor Cris reminds us of a prophecy given to America in 2020, and the three different options we were given in it. The first has already passed, so we must push forward and take hold of the second. We must consider the heart of God; He does not treasure the judgement of the wicked, so we should not be hoping for their judgment but should pray for them. We must continue to pray for our country and vote righteously. We need to be desperate and make the time for Him. Can God count on you?"
