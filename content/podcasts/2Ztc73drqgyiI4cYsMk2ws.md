hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time last week we are with Pastor Cris as she was talking about how we are now occupying this is going to be the second part of that message and so we are just going to jump into it and you will hear as she speaks that as she's focusing on the fact that we need to listen to the words that God is telling us through his servants the prophets we will see throughout the Bible that anything that God does he always tells his people that he's going to do it and he tells it to his people through the prophets so whenever we hear the prophetic words especially when we hear them repeated over a long period of time over months and years we really need to listen to it and take those words to heart and actually pay attention to what God is saying so without further ado let's get into it here is Pastor Cris as we are continuing our message about the fact that we are now occupying that we are an occupying force so God has sent or has been trying to send his people to places where they never been before but because we cannot conceive it in our own mind and we are looking at the facts we tend to ignore them but today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts because we are heading to the promised land okay do not harden your hearts so let me first go to Ephesians chapter 6 starting with verse 1 because this is a part of the prophetic instruction for this time so children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy a long life on the earth but let me clarify the children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right okay if you already have a family of your own you should not be dictated by your parents on how you conduct your family if you are a parent already you have to hear from God don't listen to the parents or parents in law or outlaws not unless you took their counsel and they are giving you a counsel from God are you getting this sometimes we twisted the word this is a spiritual warfare this is an occupying force and this is our instruction to occupy and for the transfer of wealth influence and affluence to come okay children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right it says your parents in the Lord you know honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise so first obey your parents in the Lord and then honor your father and mother that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth and said fathers do not exasperate your children instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord slaves you don't have slaves anymore we only have slaves to sin right it's talking about workers or employees obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart just as you would obey Christ this is a failing of a lot of Christians okay obey them not only to win their favor when their eyes is on you but like slaves of Christ doing the will of God from your heart and said serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord not men because you know the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does whether he slave or free and masters or employers managers supervisors treat your slaves or employees in the same way do not threaten them since you know that he who is their master and yours is in heaven and there's no favoritism with him finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power put on the full armor of God so when it says finally be strong in the Lord it missus say this is your final instruction for warfare so it means to say from Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1 those will always be instructions there will always be prophetic instruction for the transfer of wealth influence influence right finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms so the people that have been attacking us that are aligning us they're actually are captive to those spirits they are not our enemies ok put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand did he tell you to whine to call the 24-hour prayer line again and again and again and again write it stand firm then with a belt of truth buckled around your waist with a breastplate of righteousness in place and with your feet fitted with a readiness that comes from the gospel of peace in addition to all this take up<split> the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one how many Oh take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests with this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints right ok second Corinthians chapter 10 starting with verse 3 for though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does we do not get into competition we do not destroy the competition right we don't engage in the visit mess because that's the Babylonian system the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds theirs don't are you getting this we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ especially your stinking thinking ok and we'll be ready to punish every act of disobedience the timing once your obedience is complete ok so if you really want to know what God's plan for the move of God is follow his prophets listen to what they have been saying for the past few years and where are they being sent and what is their position right now what do they have or don't have you will find the answer amos chapter 3 verse 7 surely the sovereign Lord does not without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets he always reveal his plan and it's always over the course of years without telling his prophets the full details right Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 2 to 4 so Jeremiah the Prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem for 23 years from the thirtieth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again but you have not listened see the prophetic words will come rap dishes over the course of months years weeks because if you're listening to what the prophets of the Lord are saying right now it's going to be big every plan of God every move of God is going to be big okay but you have not listened and though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again you have not listened or paid attention they said turn now each of you from your evil ways and your evil practices and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your father's forever and ever see the prophecy for United States of America is come out from the evil practices of the world so that United States of America will continue to remain as a superpower until the day of the coming of the Lord who do you think God is in his character that he just I'm going to give a hundred years and then I'm gonna kill them all no he is a good guy okay do not follow other gods to serve and worship them do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made then I will not harm you but you did not listen to me declares the Lord you have provoked me with what your hands have made and you have brought harm to yourselves therefore the Lord Almighty says this because you have not listened to my words I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant nebuchadnezzar i want you to listen to that very carefully if you believe that God is sovereign and God raised up Kings and God is the one who bring them down then we continue to elect and to vote for righteous people but once the people are in position you need to pray for them because God's will will turn things around for his purpose and planned and at the same time he will judge the wicked kings or the rulers who what who enslaved mistreat his people because he is a holy and I just got okay I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon declares the Lord and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn and an everlasting ruin I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness the voices of bride and bridegroom the sound of millstone and the light of plan the whole country will become a desolate wasteland and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years but when the seventy years are fulfilled I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation the land of the Babylonians for their guilt declares the Lord and I will make it desolate forever while Babylon is still desolate are you getting this but this prophecy is what the prophet Daniel held on when they were taken into captivity he was counting that seventy years will come and they will return so he started interceding and repenting on behalf of the nation are you getting this these are the true servants of God the true prophets they look for it<split> they did not say okay God you told them I'm gonna wait like Jonah my partner-in-crime to wait until you kill them all even though they repent right No the prophet Daniel interceded on behalf of the nation and then he served the king with all his might right because he is waiting he is reviewing and said okay the prophecy of the prophet Jeremiah is 70 years so therefore I'm going to help I'm not going to delay that promise of God well the Lord has been telling us for years that the transfer of wealth influence and affluence is coming to the righteous men and women in the body of Christ not to everybody because it can destroy people if their heart it's not right are you getting this so the transfer 12 is coming for many many years and that the political revival is going to happen and manifest in this country well this 2016 the Lord said that it will start this year I don't care what everybody is saying it will start this year whether they like it or not whether you like it or not because it is the timeline of God so we need to rejoice and we need to get ready to really to really be able to contain this because no matter how ambitious you are no matter how big as your vision is and said it says no mind no ears I've heard no mind has conceived but God is about ready to do he is making a way when there seems to be no way he's even what providing streams in the desert for why because he is going to take his post in the glory position that he will not share this so whatever you'd been doing and I'm going to repeat it again whatever you've been saying and prophesying it's time for you to listen it's time for you to listen to the Spirit of God instead of oh yeah God told you about that and oh God told me about this and God told me about this and you are just going running to and fro and said it's time for us to really to really hear what the Spirit of the Lord is saying instead of listening to your own spirit and basing everything on what you desire believe me whatever your desire is and said it will not compare to what God is about ready to surprise us with but you have to be in a place of training and preparation instead of running to and fro you've been doing that many of us in the battle Christ have been doing that for a long long time what have been produced it's still not clarity from God it's still not this do not focus on your own desire remember when God took the spirit of Moses and gave it to to elder's and two of them are some of them didn't even bother to show up but they got it anyway right but they never prophesied again it's not recorded but they got the spirit of Moses it is depending on those who receive that spirit of Prophet to walk it because you got it but you have to walk it that's why importations only works for those people who really receive it and follow the ways of God instead of oh I already got the anointing I got the anointing Oh hallelujah nothing is manifesting because it's still the issues of the heart that will come to play it's still the holy spirit who is going to reveal things to come to us not your own understanding but the Holy Spirit we need to engage him every day in every decision that we make I cannot emphasize this enough whatever you know even your walk with God in the past be willing to change don't go back to your routine even prophesying even preaching even what you're doing don't go back to your routine give the Holy Spirit an opportunity to reveal truth to you on how to improve and transform that specific area in your life hello okay don't assume and think oh I thought God told me this I thought that told me this stop thinking but start listening and I guarantee you if you do not retain or even listen to the voice of men that God is using to reveal things there is no way that you're going to hear from the Holy Spirit you know those that are so anointed and so great that God has plans for them some of them have already disappeared some knew that their time is up they lost their anointing because God is now looking at the hearts and summoning nameless faceless people who do not fear men but fear God and have a love towards his people and the kind of miracles that will manifest I believe it will manifest in my trip in the Philippines if they are ready they told me that they'd already been praying and preparing for it to say that will manifest we have never witnessed before and I'm gearing up to this and whatever we saw whatever this body sowed there if you dare to believe and if you dare to listen to God including the simple instructions that I keep on telling and telling and telling you and said it will manifest here while it's happening there because what Amos was the saying that the Reapers is overtaken by the sower is going to happen in this ministry this year next month are you<split> getting this because you know it never manifested before we believe it all we kept on saying it but but no but this time it's going to manifest I allow God to train me to discipline me and I told God the things that I don't want that are good for me okay because in 2016 I told God in 2015 but in 2016 I told God it is the beginning that I want to do things for him not for me not for my own desire because it's been with me all these times it's been very gracious and merciful to me and as it's like I don't want to be used mightily I want to do things for him those are different are you getting this so he's sending me to places that nobody knew that I was there and I caused trouble but nobody knew that it's me it's me and Jesus so it's good do not desire the recognition of men do not desire the limelight and one thing for sure and go back to Moses you think I have forgotten and Joshua he is eight Moses aid said Lord Moses stop them and Moses instead of saying yeah you're right they don't deserve it them heathens them stubborn he rebuked Joshua he said are you jealous for my sake could it be that God's will is that all men will be prophets right see a prophet prophet Moses saw the heart and the plan of God that it's not his plan just to appoint one prophet for one nation his desire is for the entire body of Christ to be prophets and that's why in Revelation 19:10 it says the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ is the very essence or the spirit of prophecy don't you ever ever tell me or say that all prophecies are gone and said with you they'll be gone but not for me so it is important for you to understand that you need to follow the Word of God the prophecies of the Most High God for this time well it has to be in the in in the Bible it's not only that it has to mean the Bible hell is in the Bible and it's not the perfect will of God that you go there are you getting this murderer is in the Bible covetousness in the Bible it is the will in the heart of our God everything will lined up with a heart and the will of our God and only the Holy Spirit can reveal that truth to all of us are you getting this so don't you ever qualify or disqualify yourselves don't ever quantify or qualify yourself no it's the issues of the heart now Wow so we really need to obey the prophetic words that God has been speaking in our lives and over the church because God really wants to bring forth a revival and manifestations throughout the church throughout the body of Christ so we need to take our post we need to take our posting we need to listen to what the Lord is saying amen well we are about out of time for today before we go I just want to give you some updates next month November 28th Pastor Cris is leaving for the Philippines again she's going on a mission trip she's gonna be
