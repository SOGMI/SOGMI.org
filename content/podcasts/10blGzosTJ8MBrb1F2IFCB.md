description: "Miracles, signs and wonders should be the baseline expectation for believers; it says, \"these are the signs that follow those who believe.\" The way we get there is by seeking God out with everything in us. Each of us should seek to prophesy. Something we must remember, however, is that, with prophecy, it's not just about what to say, but also when and where to say it, and even who to say it to."
