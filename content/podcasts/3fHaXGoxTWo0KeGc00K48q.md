hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time well we are just gonna cut to the chase today we are going to be talking about doing business God's Way allowing God to lead us and pastor Chris has been teaching us a lot about this and talking to us a lot about this because it's really important because of the time that were in we need to be faithful with what God has given us and we need to be open to allowing God to lead us so this is a message from Pastor Chris that she shared with us just last Sunday so I urge all of you to take a listen take to heart the words that she has to say so that we can implement it in our lives so here's Pastor Chris we have a lot of teachings in the scriptures like in proverbs chapter 3 verse 9 and 10 honored the Lord with your wealth with the firstfruits of all your crops then this is the result your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will brim over with new wine this is where majority of the body of Christ are missing it I want you to listen to me okay a lot of Christians are offended for talking about money but if you're going to ask majority of the bat of Christ that is their primary thing that they call the need that they want to manifest in their lives only a handful only a fraction some needs healing some needs deliverance some needs all of this personal stuff right and some they want to hear from God because it's not they want to hear from God and develop that relationship they want to hear an answer for themselves on anything that needs to be done so a lot of Christians if they are tithers they are already bragging I'm a fighter all of us are supposed to so the book of Proverbs doesn't say that honor the Lord with your tie the tight belongs to God you cannot honor God with your tithe what's in here is honor the Lord with your wealth whatever it is and always the firstfruits always provide the firstfruits now it has become things on the first of the year everybody's going to have a firstfruits and said this is not what the scripture meant for every increase that you have you honor God with those first fruits of your crops of your harvest then the result is your barns will overflow I mean overflow so it got stuck into ours because many leaders they have to pay their bills am I correct they have to pay their bills so they horn in if they can only make every member of their church to tie then they'll be fine and so it's limited and that's why the blessings is not overflowing among the body of Christ because the principles of the kingdom is not being applied because tithing is emphasized are you getting this but when you honor the Lord with your wealth in the firstfruits of your crops then it says your barn will feel with overflow what is a barn is a storage is a storehouse you don't need to be concerned about your retirement or your savings or your investments if you're going to do that the bar will overflow so if the leaders are smart and if they listen to the Holy Spirit they need to show an example to honor God you cannot preach it with a four word unit unless you're doing it okay this is outside of the ties we're supposed to be generous people are you getting this I didn't say it it's here it's not that say Cristina blinking Solomon for it you only had wisdom so honor the Lord with your wealth with the firstfruits of all of all your crops then your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will brim over with new wine a lot of times I found those who select well I don't have any money and other people if they're giving money that's fine with them but there are few that they offer their services they volunteer they go beyond that when it comes to God and God never forgets them I met instant millionaires because of that they took it upon themselves are you getting this okay so honor the Lord with your wealth not with your ties okay with the firstfruits of all your crops then your barns will be filled to overflowing you know you can honor the Lord with the excellency of your work are you getting this okay with your music with your dancing with everything that's honoring God and then the Holy Spirit says or wisdom in Proverbs 818 says with me our riches honor and during wealth and prosperity every time the Holy Spirit leads you he is bringing overflowing of riches honor and during well if mr. say they have a lifetime guarantee and prosperity are you getting this so you listen to the Holy Spirit or if the Holy Spirit is telling you something it doesn't matter the more you don't understand it when you obey Him he says with me comes honor he's the truth I getting this so that's why we need to engage the Holy Spirit every time you don't cost people to give with emotional giving no you want them to hear and<split> out of the purity of their heart they are really honoring and giving to God instead of giving to you then you do not have any obligation to them except to love them God has an obligation to you okay roberts10 for lazy hands make a man poor but diligent hands brings wealth see that okay of course we all know this proverbs 10:22 the blessings of the Lord maketh rich and he adds no sorrow to it right okay and do you know this transfer of wealth your prosperity the manifestation of your prosperity is one of the crowns that you will lay at Jesus feet because it says here in proverbs 14 24 the wealth of the wise is their crown right but the folly of fools yields Fowley when we embrace the anointing of prosperity and we're diligent to it you just earn a crown well this is what the Word of God says the wealth of the wise is their crown right proverbs 22 for humility and the fear of the Lord brings wealth and honor and life here's the road to failure it's very very wide proverbs 20 to 16 and you don't want to get here right he who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gift to the rich both come to poverty right okay another one proverbs 28 8 he who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another who will be kind to the poor right okay Ecclesiastes 5:10 whoever loves money never has money enough whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income this too is meaningless to never be satisfied right ecclesia siz 5:19 because why do you love money wherein God already said humility and fear of the Lord will bring you well you don't have to do anything opportunities are knocking at your door and then it's just blessing shall overtake you why the blessing is overtaking you because you're running away from it you don't want it anymore right okay and the blessings come in such a manner that the blessings come faster and sooner than your capacity to receive them that's why we always pray Holy Father in the name of Jesus increase our capacity to receive right because you'll get overwhelmed by it Ecclesiastes 5:19 moreover when God gives any man wealth if God is the one who gives it right and possessions and enables him to enjoy them to accept his lot and be happy in his work this is a gift of God you might as well accept your destiny you're going to be prosperous and you might as well accept the fact that you're going to enjoy it God will make sure of it are you getting this I say a sixty eleven and twelve your gates will always stand open they will never be shut day or night so that men may bring you the wealth of the nations their kings led in triumphal possession doors of opportunities they will never be shut so forget about those that you've missed there are so many doors okay for the nation or Kingdom that will not serve you will perish it will be utterly ruined any nation or Kingdom that do not serve God will be ruined and of course one of our favorite scriptures I say a six to one six and you will be called priests of the Lord you will be named ministers of our God you will feed on the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast that's why we're going to other countries not to ask for money but to be a blessing right and Psalm 25 verses 12 and 13 who then is the man that fears the Lord he will instruct him see he will instruct him in the way chosen for him listen to the Holy Spirit don't be led by your own spirit right 13 he will spend his days in prosperity and his descendants will inherit the land so wait for instructions from the Holy Spirit okay Psalm 128 verses 1 and 2 blessed are all who fear the Lord who walk in his ways you will eat the fruit of your labor blessings and prosperity will be yours now let's go back to proverbs Robert's chapter 3 verses 1 all the way through 10 my son which is the Holy Spirit talking do not forget my teaching but keep my commands in your heart not in your memory in your heart for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity see that let love and faithfulness never leave you save faithfulness bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart you need to be faithful then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and men trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding see that in all your ways acknowledge him how many okay and he will make your paths straight how many paths all do not wise in your own eyes fear the Lord and shun evil this will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones we don't have to be concerned about thinning bones or anything like that honor the Lord with your wealth with the firstfruits of all your crops I already read that right then your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will brim over with new wine okay now I want<split> you to learn something from one of the kings in the Old Testament because this is very pervasive in the Christian world and we need to get rid of it because it is not a part of the principles of the kingdom you do not boast or go beyond what God instructed you to do you don't seek out the approval of man or you don't try to own something to take the credit right as part of God's team in the transfer of wealth influence influence you have to be mindful of this they stop desiring trying or wanting to be recognized let's go now to second Kings chapter 20 starting with verse 12 this is one thing that you need to avoid Hezekiah is a very good example in the business school said at that time Muro dock ballad on sunup ballad on king of babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of Hezekiah stillness Hezekiah received the messengers and show them all that was in his storehouses the silver the gold the spices and the fine oil his armory and everything found among his treasures he was showing off in other word there was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them then I say at the profit when to King Hezekiah and asked what did those men say and where did they come from from a distant land Hezekiah replied they came from Babylon the Prophet asked what did they see in your palace they saw everything in my palace Hezekiah said there is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them then Isaiah to Hezekiah here the word of the Lord the time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon nothing will be left says the Lord in some of your descendants your own flesh and blood that will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palaces of the king of Babylon don't show off are you getting this that's why it opened the door for attack it opened the door for some of the things that we could have avoided if we just didn't boast or show off are you getting this okay the next thing that you don't want to do whatever is for God don't use it for other things or for others here it is 2nd Kings chapter 18 starting with verse 13 in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah strain Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them so Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at lakish I have done wrong withdraw from me and I will pay whatever you demand of me the king of Assyria exacta drum Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold so Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the Lord and in the Treasuries of the Royal Palace at this time Hezekiah king of Judah is stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the Lord and gave it to the king of Assyria the king of Assyria sent his supreme commander his chief officer and his field commander with a large army from legis to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem they came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the upper pool on the road to the washer man's field they called for the king an Alaia came son of Hilkiah the palace administrator shebna that secretary and Joe asana pays off the recorder went out to them the field commander said to them tell Hezekiah this is what the Great King the king of Assyria says on what are you basing this confidence of yours you say you have a strategy and military strength but you speak only empty words on whom are you depending that you rebel against me look now you are depending on Egypt that splintered read of a staff which Pierce's a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it such as Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him and if you say to me we are depending on the Lord our God isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed saying to Judah and Jerusalem you must worship before this altar in Jerusalem so he's pointing out down to verse 25 furthermore have I come to attack and destroy this place without a word from the Lord the Lord Himself told me to march against this country and destroy it then le Hakeem son of Hilkiah and shebna and Joe said to the field commander please speak to your servants in Arabic since we understand it don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people and the wall they're trying to cover but the commander replied was it only to your master and knew that my master sent me to say these things and not to the men sitting on the wall who like you will have to eat their own filth and drink their urine then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria this is what the King says do not let his Akaya deceived you he cannot deliver you from<split> my hand look at this Hezekiah gave in to fear and diplomacy and he opened his kingdom for attack he compromised by taking silver from the temple just to bring peace to no avail but what happened is just like the devil evil people don't know when to stop because of pride he could have stopped right there and then but they don't know how to stop the devil doesn't know how to stop same thing with your proud than your arrogance and boastful if you are that you will never learn to stop until you really eat the fruit of it so be humble to stop so in verse 32 in part it says do not listen to Hezekiah for he is misleading you when he says the Lord will deliver us has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Syria this was the devil's mistake where are the gods our payment and our part where are the gods up surfer beam henna and Eva have they rescued some Marya from my hand who of all the gods of this countries has been able to save his land from me how then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand see he never stopped and here before you know essa kaya was dealt with but now he just kind of scorned god this is like um the gods of samaria they cannot protect the people so who's going to protect you from me so god say ah ha you have gone too far I'm going to defend them remember what Moses said that the Lord is prospering you not because you are good you are stiff that people right and this is true too talking a Takaya he is not good he gave in to fear but because the enemies have reached their evil their arrogance their wickedness that God is going to judge them instead and he would say step aside I'm gonna deal with you later I'm gonna spank you later Hezekiah but I said nobody nobody insult me I'm going to prove to them that the God of Israel is the only powerful and living God and do not insult him by comparing him to other idols or gods are getting this and don't you dare take away what belongs to him and use it for something else don't we have an audience of one so the devil put God the only living God in the category of all force God that is blasphemy when you get into some kind of trouble the trouble you cost and some help you to get into the trouble you pray like Hezekiah focus on the nature of God do not focus on your sins because there is no time right he prayed in 2nd Kings chapter 19 starting with verse 15 he said and Hezekiah pray to the Lord O Lord God of Israel and throne between the cherubim you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth give ear o Lord and hear open your eyes O Lord and see listen to the word Sennacherib has sent to insult the Living God misuk I said I made a boo-boo No I said look at them father just like us look at them father look look at them because remember when God looks at you and you're already repented he looks at Jesus ok 17 it is true O Lord that the Assyrian King had laid waste these nations at their lands they have thrown their gods into the fire and destroy them for they were not gods but only woods and stone fashioned by men stand now O Lord our God deliver us from this hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone O Lord our God then God moved and sent I say to prophesy and what was prophesied came to pass so forget about impossible situations or conditions ok give God the opportunity to show himself strong and glorious so that he will get the glory glory to God so in verse 35 it says that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian town this is one angel that killed 185 thousand when the people got up the next morning there were all the dead bodies they're getting this even when you get into trouble yourself focus on the nature of God focus on his love and mercy towards you calling him and then point out what the devil is doing one angel has the power to destroy 185,000 do you think an angel of the Lord can carry resources to you amen well I urge each and every one of you to take those words to heart we need to honor God with our resources with our time with our wealth and focus on His goodness in His faithfulness because he is so faithful and all that he does for us so that's about all the time that we have for today don't forget to visit our website
