description: "We must walk the talk before we can preach it. The great commission is a commandment for all Christians, so let us not departmentalize the ministry of the Kingdom of God. When we are one with Christ, we are equipped for every good work, that is our reality. So do not speak or think unbelief, let us walk in our destiny."
