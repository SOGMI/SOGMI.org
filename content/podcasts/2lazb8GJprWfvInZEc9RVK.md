description: "And for year 2020, in many lives for those who are going to break away from the group of nameless faceless people, those who break away, they will bring so much glory to the Lord, and we’re going to have a clear understanding when the Lord says for year 2020, we’re going to have 20/20 vision. It’s a clarity and understanding of the move of God as long as you’re willing to jump in.\n"
