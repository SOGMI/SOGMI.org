description: "Now it springs up! The Lord has already determined, planned, and decided that this season through us, for those who are faithfully preparing and are good stewards of what they have, for those who have clean hands and a pure heart, and for those who finance the preaching of the gospel and discipleship, that the transfer of wealth / influence and affluence is going to manifest. The old comfortable things we’ve been doing, even things from God, will no longer work. We cannot predict how God is going to do this; we have to be led by the Holy Spirit in our heaven-ward calling in Christ Jesus.\n\nIsaiah 43:18-19 “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.”"
