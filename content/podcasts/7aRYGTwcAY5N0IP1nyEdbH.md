description: "There is power in unity. The Body of Christ must unite and keep watch, and as we unite, God will turn this nation around. Right now the wicked are united, so we must pray for them. Let us not become so political that we become hateful, but instead let us call things as though they were. This month, the month of September, is a month of Power, so let us stay focused and remain vigilant in following God!"
