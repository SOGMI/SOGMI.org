description: "In this message, Pastor Cristina discusses past prophecies that we are already beginning to see come to pass. Major changes are coming in every sector of society. The Deborahs of our time are arising. Do not worry or get distracted. If we focus on God and do spiritual warfare, we will win every time, but if we do things the worlds way, we will lose every time. Great things have already begun happening, and there's much more to come, so let us stay focused on the Lord!"
