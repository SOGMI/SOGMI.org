  - "Joshua Sosso"
description: "God is going to use people like Joshua, people that desire to be in His presence above all else. These are the people that are going to transform this generation and future generations. The most important thing we need to focus on is the direction God has given us. Like the wheat and the tares, both the righteous and the wicked will reach full maturity, and that is when the harvest will come. As we obey God, this will be a turning point in history."
