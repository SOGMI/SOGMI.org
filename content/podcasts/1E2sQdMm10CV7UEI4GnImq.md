description: "Your words and actions reflect what is in your heart. So if you truly love and trust God, your actions and words will reflect that. Evaluate your life and ask yourself, are you doing what God wants you to do? Are you acting on your faith? What words are coming out of your mouth? Are you being consistent? We need to make sure to act and speak on our faith."
