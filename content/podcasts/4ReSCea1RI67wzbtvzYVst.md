description: "The wilderness journey is the preparation we go through before we reach the promised land. We need to be willing to undergo the discipline process and hold ourselves to a higher standard in order to reach our full calling in Christ. We cannot take any decision or opportunity for granted; we must be led by God in everything we do and run the race as if to win the prize."
