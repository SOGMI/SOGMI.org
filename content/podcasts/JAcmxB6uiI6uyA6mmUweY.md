Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and we need to get outside our own ability, resources, and understanding to receive it. In His love that passes all knowledge, we believe God and trust Him above all else."

thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time it's been such a wonderful week here for an official Church God has really been continuing to give us new revelation and it's very exciting here at freedom Fellowship because God really is beginning to reveal himself to us and we're just so excited to see what God is doing in this nation what God is doing in the body of Christ so it's such an honor and it's such a pleasure to be a part of the great move of God and rest assured God is moving in this nation and he is moving in his people in his church whether or not you see it he is working in the background and he's raising up nameless faceless people in his church and they're going to take over every sector of society because the nation's will give glory and sing praises to the Lord amen so before we begin I want to remind you guys about our weekend fundraising sale we are now into the second week of the sale and I want to thank

going to be this next Saturday the 11th from 9 to 5 and that's the last day of this three-week sale so be sure to come visit us and again we're at 80 419 Callahan Road so this week we're going to be talking about faith and we shared a message a couple weeks ago about faith about living in faith in that when we're living by faith and means that the thing that God is calling us to do we can't do with our own strength if you can conceive it if you can do it if you can figure it out if you can plan it if you can make it happen you might be doing the right thing you might be doing what you know to be right you might be following your instructions but you're not living by faith because faith is the evidence of things not seen so if it makes sense to you if you can see the result if you can make it happen if you can make that end result happen by yourself then it's not faith and so God is calling us to live by faith because the call that he has for our life is so much greater than what we have for ourselves it's so much more exciting it's more glorious it's more eventful God has a plan for us that will take us so much further than anything we can imagine ourselves so without further ado let's listen in to Pastor Cris and hear what she has to say about faith this week faith is a substance of things hoped for if you're hoping for something it means to say you ain't got it yet right any these are evidence of things not seen when you're not seeing things it may say it has not manifested yet right okay if you can do it if you can bring it to pass by yourself then it is not faith it is obedience it is doing the right thing but faith is something that will shake the earth and change the course of history of a nation or your family and everything else that comes with it am I making sense okay I'm trying to stretch your faith so that you will be in awe of the many evidence that God has already produced upon your life so that you will not focus on your desires and what you want and your personal ambition because you will ended up messing<split> things up okay the one thing that God does not enjoy is seeing his people living under what he has planned for you on what you deserve what you deserve is heaven on earth what you deserve is prosperity what you deserve is you are the head they're not the tail forget about about those voices that comes to you but how are you going to go about it you know you lost so many years but God can restore it almost in a blink of an eye so don't pine away don't cry over what's in the past because you know what you cannot undo those things might as well let it go and give God an opportunity to love on you in 2017 okay I want you to focus on the greater things I want you to focus on the bigness of your personal prophecies and the prophecy to the church for 2017 so that God can take care of those things that concern you you don't have to take care of them like you used to do the battlecry she'll get tired of or get fed up with all the compromises that we all we wanted this to be happy all we want to have is a good relationship or we want to do is to live happy and we compromise and what we compromise all of those compromises they cost us so much years of pain and affliction and suffering and turmoil only God can restore those things give him an opportunity give yourself a break look at your neighbors that give yourself a break okay what we need to remind ourselves over and over again is proverbs chapter 3 starting with verse 5 trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight right and I'm gonna show you why you must let go of the things that your hearts desire and be Kingdom minded okay do not help God whether in finances whether in relationship whether in family members you know you've been quoting scriptures left and right to your family and they're still living like even as if the Word of God doesn't have any power right if God can do miraculous things if all our power belongs to God then he can take care of those things that concern you do not help God when it comes to the transfer of wealth when it comes to God ordained relationship do not take steps and said okay this must be from God because I like it and then you went it will just postpone things okay let me show you when God gets the glory you will personally receive benefit from it and it will benefit others okay those three scenarios that are needed they must be present concerning you even in your personal life okay what God has for you what you are presently doing for God and what you're doing in obedience to God and when you're standing tall in believing him and keeping your faith in him God will even release angelic hosts and he will be active in it to bring about your prayer your prayer will be so powerful and awesome so let us continue to focus on him and not on ourselves okay bee Kingdom minded we cannot operate in the kingdom of God without the leadership of the Holy Spirit Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit so we cannot operate in the kingdom of God we cannot enter the kingdom of God without the Holy Spirit okay so this criteria God gets the glory you will benefit from it and will benefit others that's how God always operate Trinity right let us go to Acts chapter 27 starting with verse 3 this is the scripture reference about the Apostle Paul on his way to present himself before Caesar because he is also a Roman citizen and he decided that he's going to plead his case and he want a hearing before Caesar right okay so in acts 27 verse 3 and said the next day we landed at Sidon and julius in kindness to paul allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs he was a prisoner right prisoners were being transported and Paul the Apostle Paul was one of them right okay Paul foresaw the disaster awaited the ship he warned them in Acts chapter 27 verse 9 it said much time had been lost and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the fast so Paul warned them men I can see that our voyage is going be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo and though our own lives also and listen to this but the Centurion instead of listening to what Paul said follow the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship so Paul was looking at all of these things is not just about himself but also over the lives in the commerce of everybody in the ship but the owner of the ship and the pilot who were thinking about economic their investment to it they're just thinking about themselves am I correct so the Centurion listened to them because probably he works for them right because he's the owner of the ship they didn't listen to the men of God they got into<split> trouble but the Apostle the man of God the Apostle Paul was in the picture so acts 27 verse 21 because I have a lot of things to share so let's jump from one scripture to another after the man had gone a long time without food Paul stood up before them and said men you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss C you should have listened to me but it didn't make any sense for commerce here is a minister of the gospel and this is the owner of the ship and said who knows better to manage finances who knows better in ensuring that they will be able to make sail this is a pilot who's saying oh we can do it because I guarantee you a pilot like for example Southwest Airlines if they knew that there's something wrong with that airplane there's no way that want to fly it because if it crashed they're the first one to die right so in every practicality the Centurion should have listened to what to the owner and the pilot what you did because that's the world's way it is not by faith here is the man who just saw a vision so what if it came to pass but how does he know about managing cargo and commerce like some of us that's how we think we have to qualify first before we get into it and we think that is my faith no God is wanting you to translate you from your natural to your supernatural okay verse 22 but now I urge you to keep up your courage because not one of you will be lost only the ship will be destroyed what they focus on they lost the cargo do not focus on making things happen finances and relationship okay listen to what the Spirit of the Lord is saying to you okay he said last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me see God was in details God is active and so he activated the angel - and said do not be afraid Paul you must stand trial before Caesar and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you so keep up your courage men for I have faith in God that it will happen just as it told me nevertheless we must run aground on some Island because I believe what God had told me through one of his angels that nobody is going to die right but the ship is going to be destroyed same thing with the cargo but you will not going to die because look at God God has told Paul you are going to present yourself to Caesar it doesn't matter what happened if they got swallowed by a big fish like Jonah if they got shipwrecked and said Paul is going to present himself to Caesar no matter what right so don't don't say don't say and don't jump in at all I really don't see any money going to Israel but if the Lord wants me to go to Israel he can translate me no you have to obey Him and live by faith and do everything that you can before you get into supernatural or else every time you would ask God I'll just translate me there right God has to get the glory not just for you you don't want to get translated so that you can tell everybody how anointed you are remember the three criteria God gets all the glory it will benefit you but it will benefit others every time okay so no matter what Paul is holding on to this I am going to present myself to Caesar God took his time to send an angel to tell me so no matter what nothing moves me so if God tells you that you're on the verge of bankruptcy you cannot pay your bills just remember you are a part of the transfer of wealth influence in affluence no matter what stand your ground doesn't matter if you file for bankruptcy seven times you can't do it anyway only once every 13 years right so don't don't look at your own situation and said like uh-uh you talk to yourself just like me don't worry Cristina you're a part of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence and no one can kill you Kristina until you and the Lord decide that it's time for you to go and this time I refuse I have to collect crowns so you focus on that just like Paul was not focusing on own man there's no life jacket here I'm in chain with the other prisoners they don't care about us they're gonna save themselves all of those things probably are going through that's why that's why God had to come through his angels and said hey you stand before Caesar because you know why just like us we have to really pull down all those worries and concern so God is going to send an angel or die saith the Lord and thus I'm saying so down to verse 33 and he told them you're not going to die but the ship will run aground it must say it will be a total loss right verse 33 just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat for the last 14 days he said you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food you haven't eaten anything now I urge you to take some food you need it to survive not one of you will lose a single hair from his head<split> after he said this he took some bread and gave thanks to God look at this he showed an example for everyone in front of them all he took communion right then he broke it and began to eat they were all encouraged and ate some food themselves all together there were two hundred seventy six of us on board when they had eaten as much as they wanted they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea one of the blessings for those people is there was a man of God that has a destiny to fulfill see his race is not finished yet until he presented himself to Caesar so you are not finished yet okay you are a man or a woman of destiny so acts 27 42 the soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away in escaping but the Centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan so even the prisoners they were spared because of the men of God because a man of God was there so they landed in Malta right before while they were on the ship before they landed in Malta all the 276 people on board had a view on Paul that he is truly a man of God am I correct they changed from looking at him as a prisoner as a criminal they looked at him that he is a man of God so they knew that he was a man of God and he's God is a powerful God God got the glory remember now it is time to enlarge that sphere of influence and affluence and Paul so in acts 28 verse 3 they landed in Malta they were received by the natives there in verse 3 Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and as he put it on the fire a Viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand I was talking to the Lord about that this is like oh my gosh I would have fainted you understand saying Lourdes is like if I'm the one who go through that I would have fainted and the Lord said Cristina that's why I did not send you I sent Paul see God will never give us anything or any challenge that we cannot handle like his answer that's why that's why I sent Paul not you so don't worry about things that you cannot handle so verse 4 right when the Islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand they said to each other this man must be a murderer for though he escaped from the sea justice has not allowed him to live but Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects the people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happened to him they changed their minds and said he was God from a murderer the lowest of the low to God in a blink of an eye all because of a Viper so verse 7 there was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius the chief official of the island he welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably his father was sick in bed suffering from fever and the century Paul went in to see him and after prayer placed his hands on him and healed him when this happened the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured they honored us in many ways and when they were ready to sail they furnish us with the supplies we needed in acts 28 verse 30 he says for two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ because why he was thinking about himself God told him you will present yourself to Caesar you will going to finish the race that's why before he said to be absent in the body to dies to be with the Lord Jesus Christ right and then he was moping around shall I live shall I die she like oh okay I decided for your sake I'm gonna live that's who we are no one except God and you can decide when are you going to give up your ghost if you live by faith because he said okay shall I let you like I shall like oh okay I wanted to be with Christ but I'm gonna stay with you it's for your benefit and he stayed with them until when he's about ready he said I finished my race right now I said set aside for me a crown so he finished the race and this journey alone changed the course the lives of the 276 everyone in Malta it glorified God they got to know the God of Paul and at the same time Paul benefited from that he rented his own home for two years what kind of offering did they give him from Malta he says all the supplies that we needed if we focus on that instead of getting a little bit higher in the anointing and then we we want people to give us sacrificial offering it will just end there but if we are going to focus on what God is giving us without thinking about our own God will make sure that we are amply supplied well there you have it so as long as we stay focus on the Lord and the call that he has for our life he will make sure to amply supply all of our needs and much much more so let's trust in the<split> Lord let's take ahold of the call that he has for us and see the miraculous manifestations happen in our lives well we're about out of time for today don't forget about our fundraising sale next weekend on Saturday the 11th and don't forget to visit our website you can find more information about us or this radio broadcast or any events we have coming up on our website
