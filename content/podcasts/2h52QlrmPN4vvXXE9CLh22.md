description: "This is the season of implementation, so it's time for us to start implementing the things that God has been instructing us to do. The calling of God does not come at our convenience, so stop trying to predict how God will do things or try to fit him into our own box of understanding. What you prioritize, that is your god. So let us prioritize Him and surrender everything to Him. Let us value what He has given us."
