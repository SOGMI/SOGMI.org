description: "Do not allow the wicked people or the world to divide us. We must rearrange our priorities. God is waiting for us to be united and focus on Him. It is not up to our leaders, so do not make an idol of them, or of any other people. Let us stop measuring our success by statistics and numbers, but by signs and wonders. Let us take action now!"
