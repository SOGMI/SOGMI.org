description: "Jesus is our Passover Lamb. Do you know that we are commanded to celebrate three feasts in the Bible? It says it is a lasting ordinance. And Jesus also celebrated these feasts while he was here on the Earth… We’re under a new covenant… the Jewish people (had) to observe what Moses commanded them. With us, we celebrate Jesus as the Passover Lamb. This is so easy... The Lord Jesus, on the the night he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”"
