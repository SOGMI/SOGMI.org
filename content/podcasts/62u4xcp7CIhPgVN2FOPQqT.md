description: "In this episode Pastor Cristina goes over more prophecies and instructions for this year. We must continue to do what is right and avoid any delays. Let us talk about the darkness and the wicked no more, for we are supposed to be a light to the world. We must examine our hearts and allow God to teach and purify us. We must choose between the dark and the light, we can no longer waver between two sides."
