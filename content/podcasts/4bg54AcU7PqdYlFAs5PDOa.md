description: "God still has a greater work for America, so do not become cynical or pessimistic, instead focus on obeying the Lord. We need only to speak His word and do the right thing. Do not speak doubt, unbelief, or suspicion.  Do not get caught up in  inconsequential things like doctrines or territory wars; if they are not against us, they are for us. The transfer of wealth will come at the same time as the great revival and transformation in the political sector. Do not get caught up in fear."
