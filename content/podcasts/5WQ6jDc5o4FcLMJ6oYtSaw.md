description: "We must change our mindset for the transfer of wealth and influence. Like soldiers, we cannot be sent out until we are fully trained. We cannot be beggars any longer. Remember that He will never see the righteous forsaken, nor their seeds begging for bread, and that if you give it shall be given to you. We must allow ourselves to be trained and our mindsets to be changed."
