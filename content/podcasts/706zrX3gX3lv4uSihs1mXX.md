description: "Remember that we are a Christian before we are anything else; we are the governmental body of Jesus Christ. If we are not following the Great Comission, then we are not in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ. So let us check our hearts and put a watch over our mouths. Let us be instruments of righteousness and not allow our words to fan the flames of the devil. For when we get the Church to line up, this country and the world will follow suit."
