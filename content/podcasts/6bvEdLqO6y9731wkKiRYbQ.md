description: "In this episode Pastor Cristina reviews past prophecies, discusses the importance of the offices, as well as urges us to take up the responsibility given to us to make God's enemies His footstool. We cannot expect Jesus to do things for us here on earth, He has delegated that to us. We are fully equipped, so we must act!"
