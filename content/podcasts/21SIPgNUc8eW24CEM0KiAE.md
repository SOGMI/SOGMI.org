description: "We’ll become so fruitful if we’ll yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit. So listen up and apply the following instruction ok? Remember, for the transfer of wealth, influence and affluence, you need to be a generous giver, you need to be led by the Holy Spirit. Joel 2:23 Be glad, people of Zion,  rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before. 24The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. 25“I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—  the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm — my great army that I sent among you. 26You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed. 27Then you will know that I am in Israel,  that I am the Lord your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed."
