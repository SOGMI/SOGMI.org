description: "We must let God make our schedule, not schedule God around. How many times have you missed the move of God because you were focusing on something you thought was more important? No, we must lay down our own priorities and prioritize what God is telling us. We must trust that whatever God has for us is better. That is how we will be a part of this great move."
