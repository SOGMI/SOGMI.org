description: "You can call this root the babylonian system, the deep state, the illuminati, but really it will be all of those combined and then some. If you are listening to this my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, do not be alarmed but instead rejoice and resolve in your mind that you will take your post and be a part of rebuilding, of preaching the gospel, (and) of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence...  So the main root is going to be uprooted because the body of Christ got stronger and we increased in number and many have been found faithful in preaching and or financing the gospel and are making disciples. "
