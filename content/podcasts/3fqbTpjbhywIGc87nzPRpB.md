description: "We must remember that the thus sayeth the Lords that have been released are God's idea. The words spoken over this country and your life, those are His perfect will. So we must focus on God's plan, and meditate on it. We must focus on the simple instructions given to us, not the seeming impossibility of the situations. For It is the Lord's battle, not our own, so let us trust and obey Him."
