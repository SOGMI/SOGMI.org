description: "Do you know that our prayers and our ministry, and I mean the ministry of the body of Christ, Jesus Christ literally put us in charge in the Earth? The Bible says that He is seated at the right hand of God making intercession for us, and He is seated. The LORD said to my Lord, sit down at My right hand until I make Your enemies into Your footstool. That's in the book of Psalms, chapter 110, right at the beginning at verse 1. If you read that, it's an amazing scripture that really paints a picture of what we, the body of Christ, have to do."
