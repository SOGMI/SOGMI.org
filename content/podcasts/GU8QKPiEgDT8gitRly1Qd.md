description: "The authority that comes from God is the highest authority, and it is God who appoints. A marriage cannot be placed above God. Whoever God appoints, man or woman, has authority in that arena. So remember that if God has called you to do something, that is your highest calling and it is not subject to any kind of institution or expectation of man; it is only subject to God."
