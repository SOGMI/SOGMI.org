description: "We must seize every opportunity for the goodness of God. Often our opportunities are concealed as chaos, upheavals, injustices, wickedness, challenges, and problems. As Christians, it us our responsibility to take an active role and govern. Governing is discerning the challenges. Governing is being prayerful and led by God in authority. We cannot allow the lie of complacency to remain before us, for it will cost us far more than we can imagine. Complacency produces compromise, unfaithfulness and loss."
