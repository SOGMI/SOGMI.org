description: "If you are grieved with what has been going on in this country, consider the heart of God; He is more grieved. God does not enjoy the punishment of the wicked. So, instead of complaining, let us do something about it. We must seek God's intervention and focus on His instructions and promises. Let us unite and pray for our country."
