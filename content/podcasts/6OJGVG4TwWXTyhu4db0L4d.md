description: "Remember that we are submitted to God's authority first and foremost. The church has gotten the order of things all wrong; you do not submit to your husband first, for God is our first husband. And if they are not loving God or submitting to God, you do not need to submit to them. We must listen to the Spirit of God above all else."
