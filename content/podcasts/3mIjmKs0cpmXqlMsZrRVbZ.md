description: "God is training you where you are. Let us not get caught up with material things, they should never be our focus.  Do not listen to those whose main message is focusing on the physical blessings. God will prosper you, just be patient and believe and focus on what He is calling you to do. We have to walk our faith outside of our own understanding."
