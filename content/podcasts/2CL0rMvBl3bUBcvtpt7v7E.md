description: "We, the body of Christ, need to refocus our priorities. We need to deal with things spiritually, before we deal with them naturally. Review your instructions and remind God of the promises He has given you. We have a clean slate this year, so forget about the past, because God is creating new things. Move forward, be consistent, believe, and obey His instruction."
