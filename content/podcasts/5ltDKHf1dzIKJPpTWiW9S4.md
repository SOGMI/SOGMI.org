description: "We need to take on our identity in Christ. Remember that He knows you better than even you know yourself, because sometimes we, ourselves, donâ€™t know what we want. In this time, we must focus on the seeds we are sowing, as opposed to what we are harvesting, because that is more important. Let's step into our destiny."
