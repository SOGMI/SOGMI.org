description: "We are not living in the supernatural because we are not following God's greatest command: love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. Signs and wonders should be following us, for it says, \"these are the signs of them that believe.\" Once we start to focus wholly on God we will develop a confidence and boldness to do what He has called us to do. And then, we will be set free from anything holding us back, for if we are in sin, then we are in captivity. Once we are free from our captivities, we will be able to set others free."
