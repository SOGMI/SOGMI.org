description: "In this time, we must be productive. Complaining about what the world is doing is not productive to the Kingdom of God. We are called to be a transformative influence on this world. He is the vine and we are the branches; we cannot produce any fruit without being connected to the vine. Let is continue to focus on what God is calling us to do."
