description: "As the Passover and Resurrection Sunday approach, let us remember God's instructions to us: we must purify ourselves and separate ourselves from the rest of the world. God has a lot in store for the Body of Christ, but we must be ready in order to be a part of it. Whatever God has told you, recently or from the past, hold on to it and start believing God. If you go before Him and ask you what you must do, He will tell you. Let us continue to seek Him out and be excited!"
