hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening right now to the prophetic voice of our time let me tell you brothers and sisters God is on move as Pastor Cris has been sharing we're still doing our weekly fundraiser Israel is just around the corner and it's really exciting to see the entire body phrasing worship team everyone a freedom fellowship even those that aren't going to Israel they're all putting in effort and they're all working hard to make sure all the expenses are taken care of so that's very encouraging to see and God is really going to reveal to us many new things so that's very exciting this week we're gonna be talking about faith and really faith in terms of the covenant that God is established with us because you see when this nation the United States of America was founded our founding fathers entered into a covenant with God and it was a covenant of commitment that this nation would be a nation under God and God through all the years through all the changes and everything hasn't forgot that covenant and so because of that we need to have faith in God we need to have faith in God and allow God to make his move in this nation in the same way we need to also allow him to make his move in our life when Jesus died on the cross he paid our ransom that was his covenant of faith to each and every one of us and so with that we can have full confidence knowing that if God directs us if God is leading us somewhere we can rely on God's faithfulness brothers and sisters if we just focus on God and on who God is on his goodness on his love when he tells us to do something we won't hesitate to do it so we're gonna listen in to Pastor Cris as she talks about this because in this season brothers and sisters faith is going to be so if faith is so important obedience is so important because God is moving so fast that we're gonna see manifestations happen instantaneous miraculous manifestations so without further ado let's listen in to Pastor Cris and what she has to say this year 2017 is different we're going to walk in the supernatural because we're going to focus on God he is a faithful God right so what is faith what do you mean by faithful faith is confidence or trust in a person or thing right confidence or trust or if you are faithful just like what Jesus meant in Luke chapter 16 is faith is the observance of an obligation from loyalty fidelity to a person promised engagement that includes your work your work ethics need to be involved right so this is what Jesus meant in Luke chapter 16 if you are faithful in this if you're full of faith then you are loyal you are consistent in doing what you're supposed to be doing right okay in Genesis chapter 24 verse 27 you know that Abraham is a father of faith when he was about ready to die he is already planning to continue to serve God and to be under that blessing as far as Isaac is concerned right so he commanded his most trusted servant to go to his home town and find Isaac a wife and of course servant s and said like okay follow this instruction what if what if the girl would not come with me and said then you're free from that promise so that's faithfulness on the part of the servant right and faithfulness on the part of Abraham because he trusted God that God will be able to make things this is an impossible thing it's just like go and find someone from my own kin in the other country so the servant didn't know what to do but he knew he have heard and he had witnessed the God of Abraham so he prayed and said remember your servant Abraham he's the one who sent me here so could you please you know help me out and as soon as he said that and said then Lord made this girl who happened to pass by we'll come to this well and then she will tell me this I mean that is an impossible sign to ask right but remember the manifestations or the methods in the Old Testament because the Holy Spirit has not come upon everybody because Jesus had not died on the cross yet the spirit that is resting on people is only on a selected view okay unlike now we are in a better and perfect covenant so and here comes Rebekah right and in Genesis chapter 24 verse 27 says praise be to the Lord the God of my master Abraham who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master God always remember your faithfulness and he will reciprocate in kind actually even when there are times that were unfaithful when God<split> promises he remains faithful right okay and Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 9 says know therefore that the Lord your God is God he is the faithful God keeping his covenant of love what kind of covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands so what are our founding fathers have promised and cut a covenant with our Lord Jesus Christ they entered into a covenant with God that this nation will be under God right and that there will be freedom to worship and how many generation it has not been thousand generations yet so for those who are prophesying that United States of America will fall not under my watch those are false prophets because God keeps his covenant of love so for those of you who need to understand that we are really one in the bat of Christ that we should not allow anyone to divide us go to the state capitol and listen or just ask David Barton he has this library of books and pictures and he's the one who told me and Pastor Mike about when Paul Revere went to the opposite direction a black pastor went to the other direction which is not being mentioned anywhere in our history so that they will divide us he's a black pastor who's saying bricks are coming are you getting this yes and a majority of the Americans don't even know this are you getting this so it is important for us to understand that God will keep his covenant of love towards United States of America especially if we are obeying him and we are glorifying him and we are receiving what he has for us are you getting this so everybody was at United States of America will fall July oh you're a false prophet not under my watch but you know most of those false prophets they are retired or the Lord said like I better take him home I love him I don't want him to go to hell better take him home are you getting this because same thing with this we bring the scriptures over and over again but many of us didn't even know about this prophecy about the Syria about Egypt that there's a that there's a highway from Jerusalem to Assyria Trinity so when when when when the president of Egypt came in here and and he said I have very kind so much confidence in in President Trump and then and then the Prince of Jordan came in today to discuss about what's happening in Assyria and who were who were the ones who were being massacred in Assyria in Syria first Christians three hundred thousand plus and this country said nothing until hopefully now because we don't want war after all they're too far but we have a no obligation and we have a responsibility as a Christian nation so if the government would not respond Christians need and must respond are you getting this okay so God keeps his covenant of love I like that to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his comments Deuteronomy 32:4 he is the rock his works are perfect and all his ways are just just say all his ways okay so don't blame God for something bad that is happening that you yourself up cost because all his ways are just a faithful God who does no wrong upright and just is he okay and some fifty seven three God sends his love and his faithfulness if you notice the book of sounds most of them were written by King David a prophet right Abraham and Moses they all knew who God truly is and they were all anointed you know and you focus on who God is and his characteristics and don't blame him for anything wrong and don't you ever ever spiritualize something that is bad do you understand saying don't you ever spiritualize things oh and then those speak your word do you understand what I'm saying because it doesn't glorify God when we spiritual eyes bad things that we cause he didn't cause it hello because God is a good God right all good things come from him so King David Moses Abraham knew who God is that he is a faithful God and all of them are so anointed all of them prospered all of them God was very protective of them if you want to be in a safe zone stay in focus with God and trust him and believe him and get to know him and allow him allow him to open your heart and search your heart to get to know you why did I say that because Jesus might love you God the Father loves you as much as he loves his only begotten Son but allow God to know you to get into your most intimate life and get to know Jesus in a very intimate manner that's when we now understand when a group I think it's Matthew chapter 7 many in those days will come to me and says Lord Lord did we not lay hands on the sick did we not prophesy and what did Jesus said truly I never knew you don't focus on the works of the ministry focus on your relationship with God are you getting this because you have to focus that God is a faithful God okay I love Jesus to get to know you through the Holy Spirit okay<split> so King David knew God in some 57 3 it says God sends his love and His faithfulness look at your neighbor and says neighbor God sends his love and His faithfulness to you isn't that good okay that's on fifty seventy three some eighty nine eight all Lord God Almighty who is like you you are mighty Oh Lord and your faithfulness surrounds you some 98 verse three you are part of this he has remembered his love and His faithfulness to the house of Israel okay we know that and said all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God that's a prophecy that was a vision that was seen by prophet David right all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God I say a 25 verse one here's another prophet Oh Lord you are my God I will exalt you and praise your name for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things things planned long ago all the wonderful things that are happening and will happen upon this country and upon Europe life has been planned by God long ago I want you to understand that and Hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 but Christ is faithful as a son over God's house and we are his house if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast and this is the first time that the Holy Spirit have shown me in my study time all these years and I know you've been reading this do you know that the epistles that are being sent to different churches they're addressed to the faithful ones not to all Christians well let me read it to you the Holy Spirit pointed out to me and I got so excited now we have an understanding why some people are getting continue to be blessed and some people are still struggling right let's go to Colossians chapter 1 verse 2 Colossians chapter 1 verse 2 - the holy and faithful brethren in Christ at colossi it is not to all Christians to the faithful ones did you see that and said grace and peace to you from God our Father that is what releasing up blessings officience chapter 1 verse 1 Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the Saints in Ephesus the faithful one in Christ Jesus and of course the Apostle Peter have given us an instruction 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 10 each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms remember what I've been saying all these years the gift that God has given to you is not just for you it is for the body of Christ okay revelation 14:12 this calls for patient and endurance on the part of the Saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus it require faithfulness and when we are faithful to God we can pray with confidence and we'll be able to hope for better things I prayed sometimes like Nehemiah but now I don't remind God about myself anymore I take instructions for others but I used to pray like Mahamaya example is in Nehemiah chapter 13 verse 14 it says remember me for this oh my god and do not block out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my god and its services hey God I've been faithful to you I've been doing a good job I've been behaving myself just like when me and when me and Mike will go out when the children are growing up until I behave yourself so they'll come I said I behave I behave I behave so this is Nehemiah I completed the work I behaved I did my job so don't forget me reward don't forget it says do not black out the work that I have done so faithfully so he's reminding God remember remember right and I used to pray when somebody when somebody really was attacking me lord I have been faithful but so-and-so look at them don't answer their prayer I got that from the amaya remember Lord sent the laughs and all this and said eh I said while we were building the the walls and said they've been coming against us don't answer their prayer block their names from your book at least I didn't say blot blot your name but don't push it and Deuteronomy 28 - of course we know this the blessings of the Lord all these blessings will come upon you and accompany you I like that they will not just come upon you it will not just happen one time they will keep your company right if you obey the Lord your God it is so simple but if Christ and if you look at all of the miserable times because you're not getting what you want or sometimes you're jealous of others but if you fall in love with Jesus Christ your love is so overflowing that it is just like you want to share him you're not you're not going to keep others away from him but because it just keep on giving so in Deuteronomy here's the prophet Moses saying you know all of these things will come upon you if they will manifest in your life like you will lend to many nations and borrow from that they will accompany you you're not going to talk about the good old days because they're<split> accompanying you every time good new present and future they're all good they will always be good because you are with the Ancient of Days are you getting this it is important for you and I to really get time with the Lord and just to be honest and wait you keep on doing it if the Lord will not answer you one time you just keep on doing it because he's just looking and waiting if you are really going to be persistent about this why is this not happening in my life how come this is not manifesting I guarantee you there are areas that the Holy Spirit will reveal to you that because you have done this because you have said this and just like I tell you and said the Holy Spirit can wait forever until you allow him to lead you or to teach you hello because as you can see we've been reading the scriptures but we didn't realize that because even now it is being taught that those epistles those instructions they are for everybody who profess that they believe or their follow up Jesus Christ no only to those who are faithful hello ok so you need to ask the Lord why is this not happening why is this not happening why is this not manifesting or even sickness why is this happening Lord this is not from you if this is not from you I don't want it but I want to know why and how did I open myself to this I said because Lord I already repented for those eating so much chips and and chocolates but so that was done but what will I do now teach me right you find out why is this not happening why am I not getting what I want hello why am I not getting what I want and be specific about God and just keep on asking him and asking him and asking him and asking him until you finally tell you because sometimes the Lord will tell you because you did not glorify me in times of prosperity because you have said something about this person or persons that you did not correct because you kept on giving this but don't you want the Holy Spirit to reveal those to you instead of that saith the Lord you're been doing this and you've been doing that that should be God's last recourse God has been trying to get your attention so it better get your attention now because why he loves you because he wants to keep his covenant of love but always ask God why is this happening amen well I hope that all of you take those words to heart and that you're you meditate on them and that we really allow that seed to grow within us God is really moving brothers and sisters God is really moving so we need to hold fast to the Lord we need to hold fast to him and allow him to lead us into new things so before we go I want
