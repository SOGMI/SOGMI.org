hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time god bless all of you so much for tuning in this week we are going to be talking about the promises that God has given you because God has made many of promises to the body of Christ throughout the Word of God and has even through prophetic word spoken many of things into the body of Christ so the thing that we need to keep in mind is that if God told us that he plans to manifest something that he plans to bring something into your life whether it be financial blessing whether it be a new business whether it be relationships if God has said that he will manifest it then he is willing he is able to bring it forth so what is it that would stop something like that from happening it's not anything that would happen on God's end it all depends on us whether we will obey the instructions that God has given us whether we will focus on the word that he has given us it's all dependent on us and our obedience to God so this week we're going to be listening to a sermon from Pastor Chris about this about the promises of God and His faithfulness because he is faithful to manifest it he's faithful to bring about the promises that he has spoken over us it all depends on us in our obedience in our willingness to listen to him so without further ado let's listen to what Pastor Chris has to same in numbers 23:19 it says God is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should change his mind this is speak and then not act does he promise and not fulfill right joshua 21 verses 43 all the way through 45 so the lord gave israel or the lion he had sworn to give their forefathers and they took possession of it and settled there the Lord gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their forefathers not one of their enemies would stood them the Lord handed all their enemies over to them that one of the Lord's good promises to the house of Israel failed everyone was fulfilled isn't that amazing everyone was fulfilled it is God's intention perfect will and heart to fulfil every plan that he has for your life no one can disqualify you except you so you might as well cut away and stop looking the good old days those who always look back by their action and by their thought pattern they really do not believe that they have a brighter future hello especially Americans all of Americans are just so preoccupied with youthfulness and beauty and success especially in physical things everybody looks when they were young they look at their pictures they just go and they remember the good old days on how popular and how beautiful they were what happened you turn ugly well I'm just asking it is the good old days they wanted to recapture those in the past why you were even miserable even though you were popular and beautiful or handsome at those times a lot of times you don't even know am i correct but at the same time all of this is happening you look back at the past you always look and I said like and you want to recapture how you look like at that time excuse me you look at the time your hair and everything else they're not in anymore hello try to wear them clothes they think that you're in costume party right but the thing is these are the things that distracted us and have stolen years and a lot of opportunities and a lot of blessings from us because we do not appreciate what we got we want what is that the past hello I said instead why not work and be the best that you are even your 100 years then be the best good-looking and the healthiest 100 year old it means to say that you are living today today if you hear his voice harden not your heart you don't look in the past you look for something that is greater that has not manifested yet on who you are because our destiny for greatness evolved until we reach perfection what has been distracting us is not the enemy it's ourselves we have all the power and authority in Christ Jesus that's nothing left of the devil then why are we looking at the good old days when he was able to capitalize on some times of our worldliness sometimes our partner ignorance or we were not saved in those times but now we have the Holy Spirit and no matter how much try is this like Lord I want my body when I was 20 years old and I'm gonna fast and pray until them until I get it I said and I believe in I believe in I believe in I believe you hone into the believing and the fasting and praying and believing that your prayers got answered but the commandment to us is forget about those things that are in the past because I'm creating new things and today are the things that I'm creating I will even provide streams in the desert right so then you have negating it's either and who do you think is gonna win and<split> manifest even if you fast for for a year and believing and standing on it you will not have your look when you were 20 years old that's why we need to enjoy today we'll never pass this way again are you getting this okay God's good promises he said good promises all of them were fulfilled right and then God has another promise in first Kings 6:12 now God is talking to Solomon as for this temple you're building if you follow my decrees carry out my regulations and keep all my commands see the instruction if all of our personal prophecies and blessings they have condition if you follow my decrees carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father David won the heart of God in spite of his faults god doesn't remember those faults yes they were recorded in the Bible but God never changed the way he feels about David he's a man after my own heart right okay keep that in mind God does not change and because of that even when David is already dead and been dead for many many years his descendants benefited from God's promise to David because of David's relationship remember I kept on telling you if you obey God even your descendants extended family they will benefit from it right okay first Kings 8:15 this is Solomon again then he said praise be to the Lord the god of his room his own hand hast fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David when God says thus saith the Lord and you know it's from God it came from the mouth of God right okay because this prophesy to David it was delivered by prophet Nathan it's no different now when God said that's saith the Lord and you know especially those that have the office of a prophet not operating in the gifts you know it came from the mouth of God okay and by his own hand hast fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David for he said since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my name to be there but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel my father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the name of the Lord the God of Israel but the Lord said to my father David because it was in your heart to build a temple for my name you did well to have this in your heart nevertheless you are not the one to build the temple but your son who is your own flesh and blood he's the one who will build a temple for my name the Lord has kept the promise he made I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel just as the Lord promised and I have built the temple for the name of the Lord the God of Israel I have provided a place for the ark in which is the Covenant of the Lord that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of Egypt then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front that the whole Assembly of Israel spread out his hands toward heaven and said O Lord God of Israel there is no god like you in heaven above or an earth below that is important okay who keep your covenant of love what kind of covenant God has with you covenant of love with your servants who continue all heartedly in your way covenant applause - who those who continue wholeheartedly in his ways okay you have kept your promise to your servant David my father with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it as it is today who fulfilled the covenant of God himself right now Lord God of Israel key for your servant David my father the promises you made him when you said you shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel if only your sons are careful see you're the same dents will sit on the throne it will never fail that's a promise but this is a condition if only your sons are careful and all they do to walk before me as you have done right and now the God of Israel let your word what you promised your servant David my father come true and it came true and David had many sons but because of what David did to Bathsheba's husband Uriah got him killed right he promised but Siva that in the name of the Lord that it is her son who's going to succeed him as King Solomon was not the firstborn son but because he made a promise so but Seba reminded King David when he's about ready to die remember your promise on oath to your Lord and to me that my son Solomon will be king so Solomon became king even though he's not a firstborn son and the Lord honored his covenant with David through Solomon and David honored his oath in the name of the Lord to bat Siva right okay and if you noticed the ark or the temple of the Lord was built not in David's time because he said like you are a man of war I want you to keep this in mind at the time of prosperity and<split> during the time of peace that's when the temple was built hello what is the word of the Lord regarding 2016 we're going to experience political revival not with your own understanding not how the world thus there it's for us to be busy in what we're supposed to do and Lord said that as soon as the political revival will manifest in this country the transfer of wealth influence and affluence will manifest the political revival will bring forth prosperity for the body of Christ those who keep continue to do his ways and to obey his precepts like we'd never seen before in the history of the church that's how big this is and yet we continue to go on with our daily life believing and believing and believing God expecting things to happen the way we want things to happen no we have not conceived this but a price but if you do not believe it the move of God will continue to manifest and you will have regrets you have lots of catching up to do that's why it is important to remind ourselves all the time every word that God says and now we are going to the nation's we are taking over the nations and countries the nation of governance right the nation of Commerce for finances the nation of arts and entertainment right the nation of sports in other nations that we're taking over so if you believe that you are so smart and you know what you're doing and you're continuing doing your own way you're going to miss a big time we'd never been this way before you don't know what to do and if you continue to spiritualize the Babylonian system and think that God will relent and give it to you anyway God changes not guess who's got to change all of us so this is important why what you know and what you're comfortable right now you need to get rid of them as soon as God addresses them you need to cut them off say goodbye forever don't bring them back to the present you and I have to remind ourselves and you need to be conscious we may talk about the past but you have to close the discussion with the present and the future I mean the goodness of God you cannot go back and talk about the past without closing it with expectant hope about your future and your present life without you getting into offense getting back into unforgiveness again holding grudges again and the torrents of emotions and the flesh will come back so we have to be very careful in getting and holding that in and still end every day every conversation with what God is doing presently in our lives you need to just draw everybody in and pick them up pick everything in the spirit the things you cut off the things you corrected say goodbye to them and it is only God who can bring them to the future don't worry about it trust God I don't know why but he seems like he knows what he's doing right because he is loving as as loving kindness and tender mercies sometimes were merciful but we'll postpone our mercy yes I'm saying so give in to the flesh vengeance is mine and we'll say let it be mine for a season I repent later God never say Amen to those kind of things because he changes not okay so the things that is happening now especially on the things you're very good at if you're not going to submit those to God he cannot change them because remember the only one who can qualify you or disqualify you issue that's one thing I like about God nobody can hold something over your head nobody can control you so I'm gonna stop coming to the church because I'm not getting fed or because they cannot control things right and people are really really confident that without them the ministry will not go on there are thousands of them who believe that they're the one who's gone are you getting this because we always look at it within the four walls of our church and the numbers that we see daily instead of the things in the realm of the Spirit are you getting this okay and the same thing with you concerning to the strength up well you always say oh I should have done this I should have done this I should have done that and then go on on your way how many times did God attempted if you're going to be honest I mean Egon how many times a God released prophetic words of blessings to you and then you promised God heaven on earth I'll do this I'll do this I'll do that and then it manifested you're gone along the way of that blessing whether it's a relationship with their finances whether it's health what is everything else you come back and you show up when your trouble am i correct and then you're going to promise God heaven on earth again and God said okay because I am loved I continue to hope restore you back again you disappear again right he still provides for you but as far as the leadership spirit and the pioneering anointing it's not there why because God is merciful upon you knowing that it<split> can destroy you if you're not consistent with the things of God because you always go back to the flesh to the natural ways of doing things in your own understanding without pushing through everything on how God wants to do it yes to be faithful in the things of God to be consistent and following God it's not easy because our flesh doesn't want to go through our flesh doesn't want to wait wants to gratify now I want it now I want patience now right instant patience God but in the spiritual realm I'm seeing people everywhere not just in San Antonio not just freedom Fellowship Church they're getting it they're focusing on who God is and they have confidence and they will and will continue to allow God to do his ways not our ways because if God will allow you to apply your knowledge now your education your specialty and said you're going to get the credit and you can see it and said oh I give honor to God and then for another 30 minutes you're going to testify how good you are in it boggles the mind can't explain it but this is what I did and this will continue to manifest be like the widow in second Kings who was married to one of the companies of prophets who served under Elisha and we know the story she came to Elijah and she reminded Elijah you know my husband's serve God and serve under you and said you know him right and he died and now the creditors are coming to us and here's the profit you know ask this question what do you have if some of us is that woman this is like Hello did I not just tell you if the creditors are it missus say we own nothing right we were just so bratty about asking God or even asking for counseling but Elisha has to ask just like God has to ask the question Moses okay you cannot talk you stutter you don't want it to be sent you have nothing you didn't attend speech class or continuing education then what do you have I said a staff and said okay we'll start with that right same thing with Elijah he had to ask this woman what do you have oh nothing except this oil right and then said okay borrow from your neighbor's jars I said don't borrow few but borrow many simple instruction that some of us are looking for the biggies that we miss the instruction from the Lord that the first instruction is borrow many jars right and then close the door you and your son inside and then this is how you're going to position everything empty jars on your left jars filled with oil on your right right and that's what they did and you know if you are that Widow at this time you know what to do you'll disappear this is what I'm trying to tell you you disappear and you're going to do things your own way now you're too busy to manage God's blessings upon you you're too busy to serve Oh your visit to fellowship menial job or praying or laying hands on people I said I'm just going to send money right but this Widow went back to Elijah and said okay I have obeyed everything yeah that oil just keep on pouring while we have the the jars what should I do right sell pay off your debt and live off with your sons with the rest of it it is not just a band-aid type of blessing like we are experiencing now in the body of Christ because why when the blessings manifested they'll become Idol to us that we pour out our effort and everything else into it instead of God so she came back and followed instruction and we need to follow the instructions of God well that concludes our message for today but I encourage you all to take those words to heart we need to follow the instructions of God and when things start to manifest when the blessings start to come we need to not just start to do our own thing then but we need to go back to God and ask God what our next step is the widow that Pastor Chris talks about in the Bible she went to Elijah and she asked him what to do and he told her as pastor crystal the story with the jars to borrow the jars so she listened to the Prophet and what happened the little oil that she had multiplied and filled up all the jars that she borrowed now at that point she could have taken the oil and sold it right and she could have done her own thing and that would have solved her issue right then in there she could have gone and figured it out and said okay I'm gonna sell this oil and I'm gonna pay off my debts but she didn't stop there after the miracle happened because of her obedience to the word of the Lord she went back to the Prophet and she asked the Prophet what do I do and that's what we need to do when we're at our lowest point ask out what we're doing well we're highest point when we're blessed and everything's going well we need to ask God God what do we do what do I do with the blessings that you have given me and if we do that if we're able to trust God and our low points and our high points<split> regardless of what's going on in our lives then we know that everything work out according to his perfect will which is so much greater and so much more glorious than anything that we have planned personally so I encourage each and every one of you let's take these words to heart so that the promises that God has given us can be made manifested in our lives so we're about out of time for today before we go I want to remind you to visit our website
