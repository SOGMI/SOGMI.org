description: "Youth Minister, Drew Ferrel, reviews some key points from the recent Prophetic and Business Training. Drew discusses the importance of changing our mindset. In order to be a part of this great move, we must be proactive and act, seeing how we can help others, rather than what we can do for ourselves. That means that we should be a blessing, not seek blessings out. We should have the mindset of a producer, not a consumer. We should consider God's heart, not cast our own judgement and hatred. We must go before God and change our mindset to one that aligns with His own."
