description: "The prophecy for this week is Zechariah 9:11-12, 16, 17. This is for you if you are born again. This is for the body of Christ. “11 As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.12 Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you. 16 The Lord their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown. 17 How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.” God will also deal with the nations (including companies and corporations) that are against Him."
