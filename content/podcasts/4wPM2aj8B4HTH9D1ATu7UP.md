description: "Be excited, God is doing great things! There will continue to be political upheavals as He continues to place His people in every sector of society. If you open up your schedule to God, He will position you. Make sure that your words line up with what God is saying; speaking against His word shows that you do not believe Him. Let us continue to pray for our leaders and their salvation, and let us remain excited!"
