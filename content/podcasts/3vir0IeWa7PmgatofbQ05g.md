description: "Psalms 110:1 says “The Lord said to my lord, ‘Sit at My right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’” … What’s happening here is that Father God is speaking to the Son of God, Jesus, and He’s saying “You’re gonna sit at My right hand until your enemies are a footstool for your feet.” So what does that mean? It means that Jesus Christ cannot return, he will remain at the right hand of the Father until the body of Christ is ruling and reigning here on the Earth."
