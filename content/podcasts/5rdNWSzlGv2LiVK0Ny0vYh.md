description: "God is establishing His governance. We need to learn to take on His way's of doing things in every area of our life. We have to be the ones to yield to God, He will not yield to us. In the Kingdom of God, leaders of all are servants of all, we see that in Jesus. We need to build each other up to be even greater than we ever were."
