god bless you hello this is Cristina Sosso or freedom fellowship Church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time how is everybody if you are like me feeling and sensing and expecting glorious things these are exciting times it is so glorious to be alive in Christ Jesus you and I are being prepared for something greater so consider that as a prophetic instruction prepare yourself for something greater and bigger in Isaiah chapter 54 verse 2 it says enlarge the place of your tent stretch your tent curtains wide do not hold back lengthen your cords strengthen your stakes verse 3 for you will spread out to the right and to the left your descendants will dispossessed nations and settle in their desolate cities so we are for expansion we are not shrinking back we are expanding and we're preparing for greater work like I said before the believers and followers of our Lord Jesus Christ as we focus on him what is happening all over the world is great news focus on the things of God do not even look at the bad things every time you face issues or challenges look at those challenges as opportunities for you things will look better because our present and our future is far greater than our past we don't have any past anyway be led by the Holy Spirit as we pray continually for our country for our political leaders for other believers brothers sisters in Christ and for our families there are two systems that are operating on this earth today it has been for a while the kingdom of the world or the Babylonian system and the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ in the world or in the system of the world if it's too good to be true more than likely it is not true in the kingdom of our God if it is too good to be true it is from God it is supernatural glory to God so which kingdom are you going to live or operate under here on earth for us believers of course the kingdom of our God exciting things are happening all over in the system or in the kingdom of the world we have to earn everything and things take too long too expensive we have to compromise we have to trade some bad ones for good too much heartaches and afflictions in the kingdom of God jesus paid it all everything the newness of life in Christ Jesus that we enjoy now it's because of him and the wonderful thing for me is we do not need to earn his love he loved us while we were sinners so much more now in the kingdom of God there is no fear you don't need to compromise and as far as sacrifices are concerned unto God Jesus prefers our sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving because knowing by praising him and giving thanks in every situation it means to say that we are expressing that we trust him in spite of everything that we have faith in him that we believe him that he is the Lord and we know that all good things come from him you know last toufic me and Deb accidentally established another Thanksgiving Day for freedom Fellowship Church to celebrate Resurrection Sunday will be our first Thanksgiving Day of the year to celebrate Jesus as our Passover and to thank him and praise him for our salvation and of course the second Thanksgiving the whole country celebrates on the third Thursday of November is giving God thanks for this country so last Resurrection Sunday we celebrated our first Thanksgiving holiday at Pete and Aaron's house Deb baked the turkey I made a sweet potato Aran Sylvia brought the salad and everybody else brought something it was a wonderful day and we are going to do and celebrate this every year Thanksgiving Day thanking Jesus for our salvation and also I know I mentioned it last program I truly enjoyed our Passover celebration at the Hilton Garden Inn Joshua Newby where the youth pastors who led us into doing the elements that we always do the Passover the eggs eating bitter herbs the Cara set and unleavened bread and they've closed it as Jesus as the Passover lamb of course Dora and Esther Davina Nancy and all the youth participated and the three of us who had been doing this our selves for a long time me and Mike and Ed we just sat there and enjoy the entire service and I can truly tell you that the group did an excellent job and Joshua brought in new revelations of the Passover celebration like we didn't know before and it's just like we are so blessed we enjoy the benefit of discipleship from so I wanted to thank you Joshua Coby Deb Dora Davina Aaron Pete Gail<split> Silvia and everybody thank you I really enjoyed myself and I am grateful see they paid for my hotel room for two nights rest but I didn't do any work I just shared something they did all the work and I got rest to God be the glory it is really a harvest season for me then didn't end there that Resurrection Sunday ed grub took the morning service and Mike took the evening service I got the whole weekend off what a glorious life I have right now it's back to work I continue to prepare for our big trip to israel and greece and they're about 7 to 10 people joining us from the philippines we're going to have a wonderful time and if you're not this I did not push or I did not try to sell this trip to Israel to you our listeners I extended the invitation because this is very important mission for me and for freedom fuss of charts God wanted us to celebrate the Pentecost or the Feast of the weeks in Jerusalem so that's why and also I wanted the people to go to Israel to celebrate the Pentecost of course which is a required feast but I would like the people that are joining us and going with me on this trip that they really heard from God that they want to be there for the Lord as their offering to the Lord and I really felt the Holy Spirit leading me to do this this strip all the expenses that will be paid there are offering harvest to our Lord Jesus Christ so everybody including the youth were required to pay at least the $200 the pass it to secure their post and they were required to pay more and the rest of what we're going to get from the proceeds from our fundraising events will be applied first to the praise and worship team and then to the ministry team and the rest will be for this broadcast so the fundraising events hopefully will cover most of the expenses for the praise team and as a ministry and as you our listeners you have a part of this offering who you are part by praying for us for those of you that are praying for us for those of you who showed up to come and show their support to buy some items or to eat their hamburgers and organic hot dogs and some of you donated some items that is your offering as a part of this body for the Pentecost and God knows all of you okay I'm also trying to arrange on the first day of the week of Pentecost with a Sunday by the way that we will hold a press rally at the Jaffa Gate at the old city Jerusalem and or hold a Sunday service at the Upper Room I'm so trying to arrange this how exciting it's very possible that we can do both and for the team a part of the core team that are not going with me to Israel that are working so hard in helping us with this fundraising you serve you volunteer you donated some stuff you bought some you gave money you are all working hard and also you share our excitement and enthusiasm for this we are all about ready to receive an experienced supernatural from God this season so continue to continue to thank God for this and expect it okay we will continue this fundraising events until May so for some of you have not showed yet to buy or to eat or both there is plenty of time for you for those of you that are supposed to give me your spare millions and spare thousands of dollars you still have time and opportunity remember I can still receive your spare millions and thousands of dollars I do not want your pennies not unless they're dated back for a long long time that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars I want the big box it is for a good cause and you will be partakers of our grace you will not only help to fund the trip to Israel for the team we are the extra cash will be able to expand this radio broadcast how can you lose with that remember many of you when you first heard me on the radio you cannot stand me but now you like me already and some of you started loving me as a sister in Christ yes I'm talking to you even some of the Pharisees who have been listening to me to find some faults in which they found a lot okay we are also winning some of them love never fails and for those of you who love me from the get-go god bless you because of your support because of your prayer cover I continue to get inspired and strengthened to continue this radio broadcast I thank you and Jesus thank you too for probably about two years now I had been approached and was given opportunities to broadcast this radio nationwide I have been resisting it because of the amount of study time and work and I need some staff to answer the phone I have been resisting it but wherever the Lord leads us I will yield to that after all this is 2017 and it is a year of harvest okay so thank you for listening and supporting this radio broadcast and some of you you can do more okay but I will leave that to you and the holy spirit now let us go back to the two kingdoms that<split> are operating on the earth kingdom of this world which is controlled by Satan and his ways of doing things and the Kingdom of our God which we are being led by the holy spirit to implement God's ways of doing things here on earth and we know that we have the upper hand we have the advantage ours is a sure way to victory even King Hezekiah knew that in second Kings 1915 King Hezekiah acknowledged that God alone is over all the kingdoms of the earth including the kingdom of Satan or the Babylonian system this is 2nd Kings chapter 19 verse 15 and his Akaya pray to the Lord O Lord God of Israel and throned between the cherubim you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth do not distress yourself on what is going on in the world you are not part of it you stay away from it and its application and its systems and ways of thinking and doing things keep in mind that God is still on the throne and he is the only true God over all the earth the devil has no power over you ok 2nd chronicles 20 verse 6 it says all Lord God of our fathers are you not the God who is in heaven you rule over all the kingdoms of the nation's power and might are in your hand and no one can withstand you it's amazing and we are under new covenant we are empowered by the Holy Spirit we are taught and led by the holy spirit by the Word of God this was in the Old Testament but they still acknowledge that god is overall so much more now Daniel chapter 6 verse 26 it says I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the god of Daniel for he is the living god and he endures forever his kingdom will not be destroyed his Dominion will never end and for us Christians the followers of our Lord Jesus Christ mark chapter 4 11 this is Jesus talking he told them the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you the secrets of the kingdom of God was given to us we can learn the ways of God how to operate in the Kingdom of our God here on earth by allowing the Holy Spirit to teach us the Word of God who is Christ Jesus is our foundation in our cornerstone and the source of life the Holy Spirit who will never leave us nor forsake us is our power source he is also our teacher and our advocate we need to be a student of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will reveal things to us that we'd never known before you know sometimes we read the Bible and all of a sudden we sends the Holy Spirit reveal things to us and sometimes I get so upset with myself saying how come I have not seen this before same thing with you the Holy Spirit will not deviate from the heart of God from the will of God from the Word of God because He is God he will not speak on his own but he will lead us teach us and guide us into all truth he will guide us and reveal Jesus Christ to us Jesus of knowledge that a part of his mission here on earth is to preach the good news not the bad news the good news of the kingdom of God he set up his kingdom his ways and means for us to follow and implement on this earth not just for ourselves but for his glory for him and yes to preach salvation message and to matured about of Christ Luke chapter 4 verse 43 but he said I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also because that is why I was sent and the principles of the kingdom of God they're very simple example Luke chapter 9 verse 62 jesus replied no one puts his hand to the plow and look back is fit for service in the kingdom of God stop talking about the good old days he stopped talking when you were so anointed you stopped talking when you're happy when you're young when you're pretty when you're smart and everything is going out for you your past and your future is far greater than that don't look back because it's like what Jesus said in Luke chapter 9 verse 62 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the service in the kingdom of God and you want to be in the kingdom of God and he told us what not to do in that scripture stop talking about the good old days the present days and future are much much better than that because we have the Holy Spirit in Luke chapter 17 verses 20 and 21 it says once having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God will come jesus replied the kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation nor will people say here it is or there it is because the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom of God which is the Holy Spirit in our hearts that Jesus in us and that is why we celebrate the Passover right chapter 22 verses 14 through 16 because Jesus commands us to celebrate the Passover like the nation of Israel forever until that day right Luke chapter 22 verse 14 through 16 what is that day it says when the hour came Jesus and His apostles<split> reclined at the table and he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for I tell you I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God when the kingdom of God is fully implemented here on earth and who's going to do it us you and I through the leading and revelation of the Holy Spirit it also says it in verse 18 for I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes right and we know no one can see the kingdom of God unless is born again that is Jesus saying that to Nicodemus in John chapter 3 verse 3 and we know what the kingdom of God is all about Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit we will not see the kingdom of God or we cannot operate the kingdom of God or even in the kingdom of God without the Holy Spirit and we know the end we win that is why we have this confidence that's why we're so excited about the future there is no room for depression for us Christians for us followers of Jesus Christ because you know this battle is fixed we win Jesus wanted for us even before it began revelation 11:15 we're living in the book of Revelation so this is where you and I need to focus on okay the seven angels sounded strumpet and there were loud voices in heaven which said the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his christ and he will reign forever and ever we can usher forth the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ when we take our post and start implementing his ways of doing things that the kingdom of the world will be utterly totally defeated and the kingdom of our Lord and his ways of doing things will be fully implemented first in every area of our life then in every sector of society all over the world amen so stop worrying why are you distressing yourself with what is happening you are focusing on the bad things that are happening rejoice apply and implement God's ways of doing things here on earth is starting with your life starting with you accepting the love of God you're not part of the kingdom of the world you'll never fit in but you hold a special place and a position in the kingdom of our God here on earth there are simple things that you can do that will produce power and victory in your life right now no matter what you're dealing with of course if you're listening to this and you're not born again then that is the first thing that you must do you must acknowledge that Jesus is your Lord and Savior of your life that without him you can do nothing and then ask him that you want to be born again and the Holy Spirit will come upon you and you may not see changes in your physical but in your heart once you're born again you will take on the DNA of our God okay and for those that are Christians who are being born again for a long long time let us focus on watching our confession and profession of our faith focus on studying the Word of God and the Holy Spirit as your teacher ask the Holy Spirit to teach you about the kingdom of God and you must develop relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ as your beloved as your Savior as your Lord as your God
