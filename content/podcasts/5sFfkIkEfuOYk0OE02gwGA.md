America and we should this country is is the best in spite of all of our faults and witnesses it is still the best country in the world because it is founded on godly principles keep that in mind and this year I am very grateful and thankful to God for all the things he did and manifested this year and more to come this month I'm still excited for the future you and I have to do and complete everything finish everything that we set out to do this year if this year is fast and productive wait till you hear what God is saying to the charts and to you personally for 2018 and beyond you need to register for the prophetic gathering of the Saints on December 31st you do not want to miss this event price is $60 per person which will pay for your dinner and venue and you get to dress up for Jesus you can go to our website s og mi dot org and click events again it's s og mi dot org and on Tuesday December the 5th I'll be on my way to the Philippines with Joshua my schedule is very tight it is by the grace of God that I'll be able to make this trip I have not been feeling well for the past several weeks I made up my mind because if I went to see a doctor I know I will end up in the hospital and had to cancel this very important conferences and trainings in the Philippines that is not God's will and that is not my will Peter so instead I call on the Great Physician and made an appointment you know you don't need to make an appointment you can just call on him and he always answer and he always makes house calls I love that so doctor and Lord J he does not practice medicine and I prefer his prescriptions and his diagnosis is always the same no matter what whether you have cancer whether you have pneumonia whether you have a head his diagnosis is always the same you are the healed in actuality I was just being practical I really did not have any other<split> choice except to believe and trust the Lord my physical issues became a Goliath and I had to cut its head off and I have to do things God's Way or else I would not be able to do it by any other means I have been taking care of myself I exercise I eat good but what happened is I have been keeping up a very very tight schedule it's so hectic and I cannot seem to slow down or make myself stop and rest you know why I'm so excited in 2017 because of many opportunities that open up for the butt of cries for this nation for me personally and I have been seeing manifestation of prophecies fulfilled in a big way and I always want to be right in the center of what God is doing so finally my body gave up and the Holy Spirit told me to rest and as if I was given a choice in the matter I felt so bad for the past two weeks I slowed down and I thank God for Joshua for taking care of this program and kept it going I still Minister every Sunday but I slowed down during the weekdays and slowing down and resting and lying down that was the most difficult thing I had to do because my brain was running a hundred miles an hour and now thank God I obeyed I am well enough to travel pray for me for strength for energy I have two big conferences it is the same conference we held in San Antonio in September only on a much much bigger scale the two conference are expected to be full actually other trainings too are expected to be full it is our seed here in United States here in Texas to other nations and you my dear brothers and sisters need to take part of this so a seed is not too late to sow a seed go to our website at SOG mi dot org and click donate we are an occupying force and we will continue to do this and will continue to occupy until the Lord comes our focus is preaching the gospel to all nations with power and making disciples we do this we obey this Great Commission every time we go overseas and results are nothing but spectacular mind-boggling me and Joshua this December we are both determined that this conference will be the best supernatural anointed ever it is God's will and we are determined to carry out this mission insuring our time our efforts and your seeds will yield the greatest result pray for us and continue for thank God and continue to trust him you are also going to hear from the youth on Christmas Day in our program they are getting ready to travel with me to Nigeria next year they are all ministers and they are all powerful I call them company of prophets yes I am giving in finally to countless of invitations from the African continent to take the empower leader empower a nation ministers conference and of course we will hold miracle Crusades while there God is good and I expect to go back to take this conference to Latin American countries I just can't go everywhere that is why the leadership trainings of this ministry are intense as the group will be sent out there like me conducting Crusades and training and conferences with their own team so that I can replicate myself this is what discipleship is all about if God can use me he can use you to let us rid ourselves with man-made doctrines let us focus on who God is and we will have the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ front and center and if you notice me and Joshua don't take a break in this radio broadcast to announce opportunities to give you opportunities to sow a seed or to share with you what is going on in this ministry we do that we don't interrupt the the message why I need to do that me and Josh will need to relay you the message or revelation that we received from God because we want to fully utilize the time I will do that one of these days but in the meantime I would rather that I skin you alive to stomp on your toes to share the vision and revelation we receive from the Lord to encourage you to strengthen you okay we are getting revelations at least three times a week as a congregation and I only get to share with you only a portion of what we have been receiving from the Holy Spirit so I need to take every minute to share with you the revelation of Jesus Christ and no I don't want to have a daily program as you know we expanded this program and we are now being aired at KD ry and we have offers from other states to air this program as well my focus is we will cover Texas first and maybe next year we will go nationwide so if you are blessed by this program consider partnering with us by giving us a monthly pledge of financial support or you can just send your spare thousands and better is yours spare millions of dollars then we can prepay everything okay so obey God and at the same time be a cheerful Giver I said that will be a challenge for you my dear brothers and sisters if you are so happy in sending out your millions of dollars and<split> hundreds and thousands of dollars you made it in second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1 in part says that I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord and this is what I intend to do through this radio program and other available means we are going to be on YouTube hopefully in the next in the next few weeks see it is the Holy Spirit who named this broadcast the prophetic voice of our time and so I never thought of that why it puts pressure on me it means that prophecies revelations and teaching and preaching of the word of God must continue to move forward Lord did not name this program old news and stale bread if he told me that the title of this program will be old news and stale bread me and Mike have a library of many years of teachings we can air those or the Holy Spirit could have named it just prophetic voice but no he added of our time I guess he knows that because I love Jesus that I will handle the pressure of having to keep the prophecies and the revelations up-to-date at the appointed time so it is awesome so I'm meeting the challenge see the appointed time of the Lord is everything concerning you and I the appointed time for God's people to prosper is now but we must do things his way his ways of doing things not what we do not based on our experience not based on our talents we need the whole the spirit to teach and guide us new things because he is leading us to places where we'd never been before the appointed time has come for you and I to take our post and to receive our inheritance in Christ Jesus okay in some chapter 75 verse 2 says I choose the appointed time it is I who judge uprightly so when I heard the Lord telling me that I am going back to the radio and the program is the prophetic voice of our time I just kind of sweat it out but I'd rather be in his appointed time I'd rather be in an uncomfortable situation in a place where I'd never been I don't want to eat stale bread and so are you you don't want any stale bread either okay in Habakkuk chapter 2 verse 3 says for the revelation awaits an appointed time it speaks of the end and will not prove false though it linger wait for it it will certainly come and will not delay revelation in The Times and the New Covenant is started with a prophet named John the Baptist John was a different prophet like no others because at an appointed time the revelation about the kingdom of God and the confirmation affirmation and pointing the way towards our Lord Jesus Christ has come so instead of prophesying what needs to be done and what is God's plan he prophesied about the kingdom of God being near it's never been prophesied before but at that appointed time that prophesy by John the Baptist need to be released before Jesus get on full-time ministry and after John died Jesus picked it up instead of the kingdom of God is near it's now the kingdom of God is at hand the kingdom of God is within him right and then the revelation received from the Holy Spirit by the disciples as now have gotten into a different level the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but the righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit before the kingdom of God is near it is Jesus and John the Baptist now the kingdom of God is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit okay so see that the revelation for the time is at hand and we are in the time that we are receiving revelations from the Holy Spirit that's never been made clear and revealed to the past generations like what the Apostle Paul says in Ephesians chapter 3 verses 4 through 6 in reading this then you'll be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ verse 5 listen very carefully which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets only the office of the apostles and the prophets just like in the book of Acts they work together and they are now taking the center stage to build the church in accordance to Ephesians chapter 2 verse 20 right okay they were appointed by God and this is the appointed time that they are coming to the front lines that they will take the center States and they will build the charts in which Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone not the name not the people not the office but Jesus Christ front and center so what is that revelation that was not revealed in the past generations until the time or the generation of Apostle Paul in the book of Acts right verse 6 it says this mystery that was remember it was not revealed before this mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel members to gather up one body and Shearer's together in the promise in Christ Jesus the body of Christ did not replace the Jewish people we were grafted in ok so throw that<split> doctrine because that's from the devil we are not replacing anybody but instead we are adding people to our number ok and we have been receiving revelations from the Holy Spirit and what I need to share with you our listeners of this program because of limited time we are behind by few months in spite of being and just was effort to update and share with you we only have 30 minutes on the radio and and we've been getting this Sunday morning evening service Wednesday and sometimes I just sit down with a core team and share with them what I don't have any time to share because of the time constraint so it is a challenge for me to share and to release prophecies and revelations on the radio and we have limited time and I want you that when you hear when I call the scripture to you receive it and then ask the Holy Spirit to teach you you and I should be desperate for the Holy Spirit to teach us and to reveal things to us because we have so much opportunities that that I have been in the ministry for a long time but the revelations and the opportunities that we have now it is like it's mind-boggling for me but if it's from God I receive it as much as I can handle as much as I can receive as much as I can believe and you need to have that too you need to do that because once it manifests to you you'll own that revelation and then you are anointed and you have authority to share it with others to disciple others to encourage others to mature others in the things of God because you already have it and no one can talk you out of it if it's manifested in your life like for example healing is not for today so you better go to the doctor it is okay to go to the doctor but believe and pray for the Lord Jesus to use the doctor to heal you to give them wisdom and to share your faith that I believe that God is going to use you to heal me there is no problem with that but if healing is not for today missus a miracles is not for today and you are recipient of a miracle nobody can talk you out of it because you have it it is part of who you are you are a supernatural living breathing walking talking saint of the Most High God okay so we have been studying and receiving from the Holy Spirit as a congregation three times a week it's always interesting and we will continue to try to share with you as much as possible but you know what it is important for you to consider attending our December 31st conference God has so much to share with us for 2018 and beyond let us start the new year right in 2018 those that are prepared we will not run instead we will soar to new heights in the Lord glory to God and me and Josh will be back on December 21st to celebrate Christmas with families and here in the u.s.a and it will give us some time to adjust to the new time zone and weather before the conference and hope to see you there you can register at SOG mi dot org and click events and we are also on podcast if you miss any of our broadcasts we are on podcast god bless you for tuning in until next time
