description: "Remember that it is not by your own strength, but by the leading of God. When the Israelites went through the wilderness, that was their time of preparation; it was a time when they had to learn how to completely yield and rely on God in every area of their lives. In the same way, every Christian must go through a time of preparation where they learn to fully rely on God. Until we can do that, we cannot enter governance in foreign industries and nations. Let us obey God and be faithful in little so that we can be trusted in much."
