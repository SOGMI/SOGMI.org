description: "In everything we build, in everything we do, Christ must be the chief cornerstone. If the foundation of something is bad, no matter how much time and resources you have put into it, the whole structure is at risk; If it has the wrong foundation, it is ultimately done in vain and will perish. Ask God what it is that you have built on the sand, and start those things over, with God as the foundation. We must build on the rock."
