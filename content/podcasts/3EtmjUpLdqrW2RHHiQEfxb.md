description: "Pastor Cristina teaches on the importance of the Pentecost to us as Christians as well as the order of Melchizedek. We need to be filled with the Holy Spirit for the work God has called us to do, as well as make sure we are acting under the order of Melchizedek, and not working with any ulterior motives. The Pentecost is when Christians were first filled with the Holy Spirit, and brought to a level that they were never at before. God can use and work through anyone. Let us continue to do great things in His name, all for His glory."
