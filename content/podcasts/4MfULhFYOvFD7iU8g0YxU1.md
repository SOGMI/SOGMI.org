description: "Change will not come from the world's ways of doing things but by our obeying the instruction of the Lord. We must take our posts and get engaged. Remember that when so much is given, so much is required. We cannot rely on prophecies alone, because faith without action is dead. We will be held accountable for what has been entrusted to us and what we say, so let's stop being spectators and get engaged! Let us unite in Him!"
