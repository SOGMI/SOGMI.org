description: "Walking our faith should not be centered around finances, but around being a transformative force wherever God sends us. For people like Abraham and Joseph, though they were still blessed, that was never the focus or purpose in their obedience to God. And in their blessings, many others were blessed and transformed. Just as they did when they obeyed God, We must surrender our will and obey Him even when it goes outside of our own understanding. In order to be great in the Kingdom of God, you have to have great faith."
