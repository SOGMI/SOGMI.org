description: "We must fully surrender our lives to God so that we will complete what He has called us to do. We must do everything we do for the Lord, and focus on loving and praying for our enemies, not complaining about them, or wishing them harm. Let us stay on the mission, and get on His side, allowing Him to direct us each step of the way. Let us be moved by God alone."
