description: "God sent to us a sign: the autumn and spring rain. Deuteronomy 11:14 “then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil.” Joel 2:23 “Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains in righteousness (because he is faithful). He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.” James 5:7 “Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.” And the autumn and spring rains are here now. Same thing with opportunities and in the spiritual realm."
