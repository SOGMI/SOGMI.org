description: "Us being blessed and us being a blessing are intertwined, they cannot be separate. We are supposed to be the light and the solution. Because of this, we cannot be idle, we cannot be unproductive. God gave Adam a job to do since the very beginning. We need to be willing to put in the work. We must till the soil where we are. Let us look outwards to more than just ourselves."
