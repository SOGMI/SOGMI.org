god bless you for tuning in hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom Fellowship Church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time we are on our last leg of summer and we know it because our children started school this is the greatest summer ever when it comes to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear what the Spirit of the Lord is saying to the charts but the Spirit of the Lord is saying to you personally drastic changes good changes are happening and we are documenting things testimonials so that we can release a special issue of our newsletter to share to our partners and members if you wanted to receive that you can go to our website and register with your email or a physical address and we'll send one copy to you we had rain and it was most welcomed here in their County Texas Tuesday morning I woke up and the sky was clear so I took advantage of it I took my gardening gloves and started pulling weeds you know it is the best time to pull weeds when the ground is wet well I was pulling weeds I was talking to God and meditating on what he is doing in our lives and I was meditating on it I was grateful the Lord told me this you know Cristina you need to tell my people that when my spirit is moving on the earth while the spiritual atmosphere is saturated with my presence it is time to pull weeds from their lives it is time for us to be teachable the Lord is making a way even in the desert and things are springing out things that are new it is time for us to have a listening ear and a yielded miss to be led by the Holy Spirit it is time for us to make corrections amends any even repentance and let us change course while the Spirit of the Lord is releasing blessings through prophetic words let us pause and listen and be grateful it's time to pull them weeds and some of the weeds that we need to pull out from our lives are our traditions man-made doctrines that limit God and are keeping God's people from maturing we still try to practice things or try on things did not work in the past but we got stucked in all of those methods we sometimes even marry methods and they're still not working several weeks ago I was asked by one of the members of freedom Fellowship Church to pray for their friend who was seriously ill I got his phone number and I called and he is been wanting to really come and see me he wanted to live so I went and made an arrangement to pray for him at their house and I told him that God is going to honor his request his desire and I let him in the prayer but some of the members of his family were not in agreement they wanted to let him go so after a few days after I prayed for him in their house I called and check on him I was specifically told by a member of the family not to come and pray for him I was saddened by that but I respected that and I kept on praying in the spirit for this brother a few days after I was told not to come and pray for him that brother died that was hard on me because I know he still has lots to give and I know that it will glorify God I feel sorry for the members of the family I don't feel sorry for the brother who passed he's in heaven now if you've been to her nobody who went to heaven wants to come back here on earth I feel sorry for the members of the family and what they have missed then again God's mercy is upon them all and he still loves them keep that in mind God is so loving and merciful one thing I love about God is that he never ran out of things or ideas or ways or systems or concepts and he is never broke I never heard God saying Cristina I don't know what to do I've done everything that I can I don't know what else to do he never run out of ideas he is all-knowing all-loving all holy all excellent all powerful start looking and focusing on who God is and when you read the Word of God you ask the Holy Spirit to give you understanding and to illuminate what you're reading in the word so let us go back to the blessings of the Lord especially the rain that we just got Leviticus chapter 26 verse 4 says I will send you rain in its season and the ground will yield its crops and the trees of the field will produce their fruits deuteronomy 11:14 then I will send rain on your land in its season both autumn and spring rains so that you may gather in your grain new wine and oil we are fertile ground just say this I am a fertile ground for the planting of the Lord I can see visions and prophecies manifested in a big way things I'd never witnessed before since I entered the ministry example I have been teaching business and prophetic schools for many many years God got me started on prophetic school in January 19 of 2003 and Business School spring of 2004 everywhere he sends me to different countries I always include the<split> prophetic and the business schools in addition to healing Crusades or miracle Crusades and ministers conferences all over the world the lord jesus healed thousands of people in the philippines alone just in the philippines alone for the past 10 years i'd been there about 25 times i ministered from the least to the greatest of them all and god always moves i want you to remember that god always move when God tells you to do something or when God gave you a word or prophecy about you you believe him because he is God and you asked the Holy Spirit and you follow the instruction he is so awesome we ministered and empowered thousands of pastors and leaders we ministered to the youth all life changing it's been a decade of planting an awesome harvest is now here in the summer of 2016 I am seeing results in the economic sector in the sports arena as well as in the arts and entertainment and believe it or not in the government fulfillment of God's prophecies to the church even the state of Texas in this country are manifesting like never before these is the season that we in the Lord spoke to me in 2013 that as soon as my daughter Erica graduates from high school he will be sending me all over North America so my daughter just started college this week and I am leaving for Canada next month to minister I will also be meeting and spending time with one of my February couples both pastors from the Philippines they're the one who made the connection glory to God in addition to the testimonies that I've been witnessing and manifesting all around us this season for the first time many companies not just one or two but many companies or businesses are formed and established and not just here in this country by also abroad I can now see the harvest coming and we continue to increase a number the Lord is sending people from different nations and from other states to this ministry so that they'll get trained in the prophetic and business school they are part of the transfer of wealth isn't that amazing the Lord gave me that prophecy in 2004 and it's finally manifesting in a big way see my brothers and sisters we need to apply God's ways of doing things here on earth in our Sunday services the Holy Spirit has been revealing things to us and he changed the direction of the service several times which I am more than glad to yield to his leading the core team is getting it the young people are getting it our prayer life changed our outlook chains and there is an increased excitement in the air I don't know about you but I wanted to challenge you as I challenged the core team I am always curious in finding out what I'm really made of I don't shrink from challenges I don't look for them though I want to find out my limit in the things of God so far he is leading me to ways and means that I never thought possible I really desire the Word of God to come alive in my life and continue to manifest himself in my life and this ministry and more than anything else is starting this year I want the Word of God proven in my life of course this requires discipline and yielded nough stew the leading of the Holy Spirit but I am up to the challenge because I know I will never pass this way again the challenge of today this is my opportunity as I will have more opportunities tomorrow but today when every time I hear his voice I will yield to that voice the voice of the Holy Spirit so I challenged the team last Sunday to allow the Word of God supernaturally in an awesome way be proven in our life concerning the prophecy that in 2016 we will look good we will feel good we will live good will be good and we will do good all for the glory of God for our own benefit and for the benefit of his people we will shoot for the impossible things that will boggle the mind I want to be proven on this we are the fertile ground in which the Word of God the parable of Jesus was talking about when the rain started pouring here in San Antonio area I prayed and I prophesied that it is going to be a good soaking rain no flooding in vakani especially where I live God is faithful we didn't have any flood here it's time for you to take authority to where you're at that is your spear of influence and that is your authority the Lord planted you there to be a light and to be in authority so we're going to pull out weeds from our lives to increase our faith right okay in the gospel of look it's also in mark and Matthew Jesus spoke of the parable of the farmer who sowed seeds and then he explained the parable to his disciples he clearly explained this to his disciples the importance of understanding and we even in this days we need to get what he is really saying to the church even in this season in March after 4 verse 13 clearly says then jesus said to them don't you understand this<split> parable how then will you understand any parable verse 14 he says the farmer shows the word and he also explains in Luke chapter 8 starting with verse 11 Luke chapter 8 verse 11 this is Jesus talking this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of God I want you to keep this in mind okay we use this scripture we read it before we take up an offering in our services and we talk about the thirty sixty and a hundredfold return what Jesus is talking about is not about our sowing seed is not about our tithes and offering it's about us receiving whether it's preaching whether it's teaching in our services or whether it's a prophetic word or thus saith the Lord he is talking about that he's not talking about money as a return for your offering let us apply and teach the true intent of the word of God we are so stocked on trying to get people to give so that we can pay our bills I understand the pressure okay I have to believe God to pay all of our bills every month including this radio broadcast see we are not getting or we're not receiving any financial support from the listeners I'm just being honest with you so I have to believe God to pay all our bills every month but I refuse to even use this radio broadcast to get God's people to give it is time for us leaders to start teaching the people the importance of sowing seeds and then we'll leave them alone I don't like emotional giving but I want a cheerful giving from your heart or that you obey the Holy Spirit so this parable of the farmer who sowed seeds is about us the listeners of the Word of God when the Word of God is preached or when a prophetic words that say 'lord were given to you you are that ground and the Word of God is the seed because why Jesus is the word of God right so we are the ground we are the soil Jesus made that clear so let us not use the scripture or quote the scripture when it comes to taking gifts and offering okay repeat this after me I am a fertile ground okay so let's go back to Luke chapter 8 verses 11 through 15 this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of God verse 12 those along the path are the ones who hear and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved those that you give them a word and they don't believe it preaching they pick and choose which ones they believe it is the devil who stalks them out using their minds and their reasoning and takes away the word from their hearts because this is Jesus explaining okay verse 13 those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it but they have no root they believe for a while but in the time of testing they fall away what is the meaning that they have no root they're not being discipled they're still immature and they didn't go for the defense of God or not being led by the Holy Spirit they're not consistent okay remember I'm pulling weeds they believe for a while but in the time of testing they fall away they look at the facts instead of the truth 14 the seed that fell among thorns stains for those who here but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries riches and pleasures and they do not mature those that fell among the thorns this is the one thing that I want to hone in on you today especially life's worries they choked the Word of God yes but also riches and pleasures I've prophesied to hundreds o thousands of people okay and those who want something from God those who are believing something from God every time they're there they volunteer they always show up but once they get what they wanted or they think that they got what they wanted for a while they disappear and you're only going to hear them when they get in trouble again and some even the blessings of God the pleasures of life they go after them they focus on them now they're too busy they're too busy to honor their commitment to God and to his people so they do not mature so focus on the ones not the life's worries it's the riches and pleasures because this is the main issue and challenged by the body of Christ they are not consistent when God blessed them and the blessings manifest then it become an idol to them all of a sudden they will focus on all their attention and time and resources in that particular blessing and becomes an idol anything that comes before God is an idol so riches and pleasures and they do not mature but the seed on good soil stands for those with noble and good heart who hear the word retain it and by persevering produce a crop right and it was explained in Matthew 13:23 and Mark 4:8 but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil as the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown so the seed is the<split> word of God is not money okay it is you how do you receive a preaching or a teaching by the Word of God how do you receive and follow through the prophetic words the personal prophecies that was given to you how did you receive them if you receive them with an open heart and kept on Mary taking on them and following the instructions you are that fertile ground who will produce a crop that will yield 60 30 or a hundredfold return so we are that soil fertile ground the Word of God I repeat is the seed who is Jesus Christ so prophecy is released upon your life for the church for this country those who heard the prophetic words those who obey the instruction to the letter will now receive abundant harvest in every area of their life in every sector of society the church is emerging as a glorious and victorious church we increase in number every day and we will be known in every sector of society because we will glorify the King of Kings and the Lord of lords Christ Jesus you don't believe me what's the rerun of the Rio Olympics majority of the winners those who broke the record did not even blinked when they glorified our Lord Jesus Christ with billions of people all over the world watching prophecy released in 2012 2013 14 15 and 16 about the athletes and that God is going to use the sports to bring back his people and to reach out many people with a condition those athletes who acknowledge God those who glorify Him he will elevate them in a position of prominence that was the prophesy glory to God now in this country God is placing his people to position or prominence in the economic sector arts and entertainment research and development and glory to God politics even in politics we are going to experience political revival in this country keep on praying remember but if Christ we have to unite our unifying force is Christ Jesus and our language is love so you are the fertile ground for the Word of God released in your life through the preaching of the word and the holy spirit I know he's been talking to you I want to emphasize this again it doesn't matter what is going on in your life right now if you hear and believe if you take to heart what God released upon your life those blessings cannot be reversed except value hmm some of them got delayed because of your unbelief you have forgotten about them or you did not give God the glory but today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts so you take heart what has been released upon your life because those blessings cannot be reversed except by you God changes not his plan for your life will be and shall be fulfilled it depends on you if that blessing will manifest after many years in a century after a few months after a few days or weeks but no one can steal that from you it is you who can reverse those things God's plan for your life he is mindful of that plan it is time for you to take him seriously he loves you you are included in the plan of God for this year and for many many years to come he has a plan for your life receive and believe that now in the name of Jesus I say a 46:11 from the east I summon a bird of prey from a far-off land a man to fulfill my purpose what I have said that will bring about what I have planned that I will do sound forty verse five many Oh Lord my god are the wonders you have done the things you plan for us no one can recount to you where I just speak and tell of them there will be too many to declare I say a 25100 Lord you are my God I will exalt you and praise your name for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things things planned long ago so keep in mind that God has a plan for you and this plan for your life cannot be reversed except by you always remember that and I am running out of time again god bless you for tuning in
