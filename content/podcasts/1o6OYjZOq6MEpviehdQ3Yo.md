description: "Christians should always be the best workers, because everything we do should be an act of worship to the Lord. A true leader is a servant of all. In this sense, a lot of people have leadership backwards in the Body of Christ. It is not about seeking the limelight or trying to establish yourself. You must focus on serving and obeying the Lord, and then you will be found trustworthy; we have to walk our faith and be found faithful where we are now."
