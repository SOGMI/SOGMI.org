description: "We must focus on the bigger picture, not just our own ambitions; we must go after God's plan and purpose for this country. Everything we do-- our vision, our purpose, how we execute things-- must come from Him, because we cannot process or achieve it with our own understanding. As long as we focus on Him and His people, the transfer of political influence to the Body of Christ will coincide with the transfer of wealth. We must be faithful now, and let the Holy Spirit teach us. Exciting things are ahead!"
