description: "We must be persistent in praying and obeying God. We cannot make assumptions about how things are, or what will be done. We must focus instead on what God is telling us and be persistent in following it. The nation has gotten where it is because of the church letting up and becoming complacent. We cannot wait until November, or wait for someone else to save us and make a change, we must obey God and be persistent now."
