description: "Listen in as Pastor Cristina tells us the four things we must focus on: 1) the great commission. 2) Teaching and preaching the revelation of Christ. 3) Operating under the priesthood of Melchizedek, and 4) making disciples. We focus on these and continue to let God lead us so that we can be transitioned into the supernatural."
