description: "We need to be sure we are applying the principles of God, not the principles of the world. The structure of the church is going to be transformed according to the image of God, not according to man. So let us shift our mindset. We need to focus on being a blessing, not receiving blessings. We need to start thinking bigger and focus on bringing life. Most of all, we must remember that we will not get anywhere if we do not establish a relationship with our Lord Jesus. Choose today that Jesus will be your first love in every facet of your life."
