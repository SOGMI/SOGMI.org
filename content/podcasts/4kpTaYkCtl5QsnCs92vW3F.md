description: "In this episode, Pastor Josh talks about the faith and obedience that led to the birth of our savior, Jesus Christ. For great, supernatural things to happen, we must be people of immense faith. That means following God, even when it goes against what makes sense to us, what is expected of us, and what we might fear others will say. It is through this faith and obedience that great things will come."
