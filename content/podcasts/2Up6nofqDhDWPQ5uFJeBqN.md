description: "If you were born again, then your past is gone away; we must not look behind but press ahead and look forward. We are joint heirs in Christ, that is our identity in Him. If we truly know who we are in Christ Jesus, we must live it. It must be seen in every area of our life. We cannot compartmentalize the Body of Christ. We cannot live like the world when our identity is in God."
