description: "We need to continue to allow God to transform us into the image of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. We need to allow the Holy Spirit to teach us and lead us to the new things He is doing here on Earth. Now He is leading us to the path that we’ve never been before. So all these talents and gifts and dreams and visions that laid dormant are now being resurrected and they’re being stirred in our spirit being. We must prepare ourselves for this great move of God that is already here, and also we need to prepare and train others."
