hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time we are now two weeks into the year 2017 and it's all very exciting to see the things that God has planned for this year so this week I'm gonna be sharing with you a message that Pastor Cris shared with us this past Sunday and we're just going to get right into it the first opening passage that she shares what this is kind of long way I encourage you to listen to the whole thing so that you can see how it is related to the time that we are in now and it's in Deuteronomy and it's Moses addressing the people of Israel because they have turned from God and so we're just going to get right into it so without further ado here is Pastor Cris let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 4 because he didn't trust God enough now he's not going to lead these people millions of them towards a promised land but Moses reminded them on how God moved mightily this is the best thing that he can do for them he told them that I begged the Lord to give me a chance to enter just enter the Promised Land and the Lord said I will not hear any of it right so in Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 25 he says after you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idle doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and provoking him to anger I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess you will not live there long but we'll certainly be destroyed it says like if you're going to do this our founding fathers of this country have given up their life so that this nation we'll be under God and unprecedented that the prosperity of United States of America isn't an envy throughout the world it is the only country that people are dying to come in instead of they're dying to get out are you getting this okay so Moses knew what's gonna happen so he he he told them I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess you will not live there long but will suddenly be destroyed the Lord will scatter you among the peoples and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you there you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone which cannot see or hear or eat or smell it's so different on what we are serving now we're serving and they're worshipping traditions of men in the church instead of falling in love with Jesus okay when you are in distress and all these things have happened to you then in later days she will return to the Lord your God and obey Him for the Lord your God is a merciful God he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the Covenant with your forefathers which he confirmed to them by oath ask now about the former days long before your time from the day God created man on the earth ask from one ends of the heavens to the other has anything so great as this ever happened or has anything like it been heard off has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire as you have and lived has any God ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation by testing by miraculous signs and wonders by war by mighty hen in an outstretched arm or by great and awesome deeds like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes you were shown this thing so that you might know that the Lord is God besides him there is no other from heaven made you hear his voice to discipline you on earth he showed you his great fire and you heard his words from out of the fire because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them he brought you out of Egypt by his presence and his great strength to drive out before you this is the purpose to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance as it is today as it is today acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below there is no other as it is today God in 2017 has allowed us to come into this to drive out nations that are greater than us the kingdom of the world and this is unprecedented and God wanted me to read this to you so that you will not forget him when your name will become renown when all the desires of your heart have manifested will you still come and hunger for him or you're just too good and anointed to hear from him again that's why the Lord loved consistency because it's a show of discipline and at the same time it's humility that it doesn't matter if you know everything there's still another room to know some more and it is<split> humility to allow God to change your schedule and to fit in into his it is important for us to have a mindset now because what is about ready to manifest in our lives is as much as we can handle as much as we can receive as much as we can believe and it is by our own obedience because it's already set up everything is full-blown everything is fully grown as far as the seeds that were sown in the past but at the same time the opportunities for today the best seeds that we can sow to is our time is our heart to dedicate and to offer our heart and our time to him and our attention to him instead of I just want to hear from God I wanted to hear from God I want to hear from God because I have this problem I want this confirmation and I want this just because you love him just because you know that he is a good god it all points towards trust and confidence on who you are and who he is the time has come you know spiritual leaders for many many years and they're still doing it but it's about ready to change and when things got changed they cannot explain what happened because they have hardened their hearts they make things complicated they make things complicated so that's why so that they can lord over other people that they can be more anointed they're more understanding you know the anointing now is going to change and turn into a different perspective of what the anointing is the manifested goodness of God because I said well I want a Lord we want your presence he already said he's everywhere right so it cannot be that because he's everywhere is his manifested goodness because once you obey God once you praise and worship God as God and him alone then what goodness and mercy will or shall follow you all the days of your life right it is important for us to simplify because if you read the four Gospels you're not going to be confused and I don't know how God can do this when the Holy Spirit will breathe and I said all of a sudden you get a deeper or a different understanding like if you have one scripture you can read the text and be able to teach about five to ten different subjects on that scripture because of the illumination of the Holy Spirit right because of the revelation of the Word of God and that's what he's wanting us to do and the in time you look at the four Gospels they're very clear you understand them then religiosity and man-made doctrines complicate things hello how do you approach God oh you have to do this you have to do that enter his gates with Thanksgiving and and praise in our heart and all of these things and and just to get God's attention God is looking at the heart not performances right and then it shows us that the four Gospels have broken a lot of our ways and means and methods that we intermarry and how to approach the throne of grace to approach God blind bartimaeus just just messed up the whole theology of that Jesus son of David have mercy me be quiet shut up no he went louder until Jesus said what do you want from me he said Lord I wanted to see that's it like okay how to healed the blind say okay how can you study that Jesus already explained it to us very very clearly that all of those supernatural things because remember he was a son of man for three years when he entered the ministry he was not a son of God until he was baptized by the Holy Spirit am I correct and then he started saying My Father in Heaven but among all of these things every time that there is multiplications up loaves and fishes it is not about methods you cannot sell a book in the principles of the multiplications of loaves and fishes except for one thing that is very evident that you don't need to write a book you don't need to buy a book just get it his relationship with father God I thank you Father that you have given this revelation to the children for your glory I thank you my father he always include the father so that the father the son the Holy Spirit were in there three of them right and it is the relationship of Jesus Christ to Father God and then he said I am going to allow you to have the same type of relationship that I have that's why it is good for me to go away because then the Holy Spirit will come upon you and when the Holy Spirit will come upon you you'll be endued with power acts 1:8 am i correct so the Holy Spirit has now come and it is it is time for us to be endued with power with understanding and revelation if you're going to throw away everything your methods your theologies and just allow the Holy Spirit to minister personally to you and to tell you personal stuff and do them if you want to get anointed that's where you're going to need to start because no matter what if you're going to follow Jesus pattern he never had the same pattern as far as healing except his pattern with I only do<split> those things that I see my father do I only say those things that I hear my father then who hears it is the Holy Spirit and now it is the same Holy Spirit who teaches us how to connect with God the Father and God the Son because he says he will not talk about himself he's only going to speak what he hears where is the Holy Spirit hearing and listening in heaven between God the Father and God the Son hello that is the only thing that is very constant and it's the general truth because if you're going to follow the pattern of Jesus you'll get confused and you'll be in trouble are you getting this could you imagine a blind person comes in here and then you get a mud you spit it and then you put it in his eyes and then go to the bathroom and wash your face hello and never waver so the blind man went in there and then he starts saying how can you have that kind of thing so one time I was really frustrated I was very grateful of the people that got healed but I wanted that everyone who came it doesn't matter whether they believe or not it's in my heart no matter what and said if I'm going to lay hands of them I want them to get healed but I haven't gotten to the point in the ministry that everyone's manifested healing came about and I was very frustrated and said how can I do greater things if you're not going to teach me how you do it what are the principles of it and then he showed me a certain thing a blind man that healing hands in the gospel of look that he lay hands on this man I think three times lay hands on him what do you see I see shadows or light lay hands on him again I see people like trees lay hands on him again all I can see so the Lord said don't ever give up you can lay hands on the sick not just once because that is not the principle but we only move based on our own revelation okay the only move based on our own revelation just like the late Oral Roberts he will not lay hands until he's ready for his faith and he feels electricity in his hands I copied that the Lord with his mercy and patience he allow me to do that I started prophesying I started laying hands on people I started laying hands and they're getting slain in the spirit and I said because and then after that nothing my hands were cold as ice and all he'll tell me is the just shall live by faith I know that I'm living by thing and said the just shall live by faith but where is it where is it and said no I realized that it is not by your emotions or feelings it is by your belief you have to change your mindset and you have to always always guard your hearts and sit like okay and then now sometimes I feel such great power coming me sometimes don't feel nothing but the one thing for sure I will not allow the wicked people or Satan to see me quaking in fear that I'm in doubt just like it has been my practice even if I don't have any money nobody will see because the way I dress is I'm saying because I refused to make a lot of noises and cry that you are in need but I'm believing God and this is like you know you have used that numerous times you have been complaining and repeating things about your pressure about your money issues about your health issues and especially you with money when there's a need oh I woke my faith I believe God is there somewhere it's there somewhere it's there's some if you know that it's there somewhere stop talking about it just prove it are you getting this so it is important for us to change our mindset in just get away all of those even habits that we have so that God can give us heavenly and good habits much much better than what you have right now hello when you are in need isolate yourself but don't ever ever let anyone know not unless the Holy Spirit said you can ask so-and-so to agree with you and they still don't say anything and then keep it because that is living by faith but of Christ not when you make a lot of noises everybody knows that that you're in that everybody knows that you're short of money everybody in their town and you had the audacity to say that you live by faith hello okay I know I'm stepping on some probably one person in this room your toes but it will be beneficial for all of you that I'll confront the issues so it is important for us to understand this so that we can start a wonderful wonderful love relationship with father God that we remove all the entanglements and the middle people be the persons in your life in your walk and have the holy spirit to have one-on-one with you I guarantee you the Holy Spirit will not teach you or will not tell you to rebell hello that is not the Holy Spirit it's an Holy Spirit that you've been listening about he's not going to teach you to repel but he is going to show himself strong in you so that you'll begin to understand remember sometimes especially<split> when we're about ready to start when we just got born again we saw everything we eat everything right because we are so hungry for the things of God like little children they start crawling they focus on one thing right they have to taste it they have to put it in their mouth right and that's how we are when you first started walking in the spiritual realm and of course your calling you gravitate you were attracted to the same people and the calling and and if the Holy Spirit it will not be allowed to have that one-on-one teaching with you and him leading you it gets contaminated I was so attracted with the gift of prophecy because the Holy Spirit will whisper to me and said this gonna happen this is who you are and yet I want a person to tell me exactly what the Holy Spirit told me and said and the holsters I already told you Cristina yeah but well I was immature and I followed all the prophets including false prophets but one thing I accidentally stumbled into after every meeting after every teaching I go into my room and ask the Holy Spirit this is what I learned today could you illuminate to me what are the things that are not from you this is my understanding please correct me if I'm wrong and I put a question mark on some of the things that I heard and then he will visit me in my sleep or sometimes he'll talk to me in an audible voice and redirect those things and I always wonder and said how come am I the only one who's hearing or is this my imagination that I hear from you the worst that's why I called you in the prophetic to bring about changes you're going to tell them and said I got into trouble it's your fault and I got into trouble but you know what don't hesitate to be peculiar or to stand alone in some instances you really have to buck the pressure and to stand alone you'd need to take that risk that well if I don't hear from God he's going to tell me anyway but because why God knows the heart if your heart is I want to obey God I'll take the risk do you think he would say that oh you ignoramus you and said you deserve what you got by trying to hear from me no he is more than happy if your heart is right before God he is going to spoil you but you will not be rotten you are not spoiled rotten he is going to spoil you because he's always defend you he's always protect you he's all going to bless you even the things that you don't deserve just because your heart is right before him that you want to know him amen so as long as our heart is in the right place God is going to have our back so there was a lot to ponder and think about for this last thing that we just listened to and I just want to do a quick review so she said at the beginning Pastor Cris said at the beginning that God is raising up the church this year to take on Nations larger than itself to take down the system of the world and the important thing is that as he is empowering us the church this year to step forward as he's been raising up nameless faceless people to establish his kingdom we have to remember that as we become successful as he blesses us as we move forward we cannot forget God we cannot forget God like the Israel lights forgot God even after he pulled them out of Egypt with signs wonders miracles see God is using his divine intervention and he's raising up the body of Christ this 2017 and he's going to act miraculously even though we're not seeing it so we have to remember as he pulls us out of those areas and into prosperity and abundance we have to remember God we had to look back and we'd be grateful for what God has done in our lives and the other important thing is that as God is calling us into this things we have to be led of the Holy Spirit in all that we do as Pastor Cris talked about Jesus he only said those things that he heard the father say and he only did the things that he saw the father do so we have to be led of the Spirit and everything as we go about our day everything we had to be going back and saying God what do you think about this I learned this today I did this today does it line up with your will does it line up with what you have for my life is this correct or is there something I need to change just as Pastor Cris when she was first learning about the gift of prophecy she went back to God and she asked God is this right or is this wrong does it line up with your word and that's what we need to do with everything in our lives regardless of what area of our life it is we have to take it back to God and say God what can you reveal to me so that in everything that we do we're receiving the illumination of the Holy Spirit and that illumination the heavenly wisdom it's the same reason we can read a scripture verse 50 times and come back to it say a couple weeks later and we'll still learn something new<split> from it and it's because of the illumination of the Holy Spirit and that needs to be applied in every area of her life so I hope you guys were blessed by this message today if you
