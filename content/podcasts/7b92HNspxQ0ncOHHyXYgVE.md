description: "Everything we do, in every area of our life, should be embedded with the light of God. That is the full time ministry we should focus on; obeying God and being the light everywhere we go. Then, when we are the innovators, the pioneers, and the trendsetters, we are establishing things with God's ways and light interwoven into them for the benefit of many that will follow. We see this in how our founding fathers established this nation and government. Let us go before the Lord and get direction from Him. Let us make sure that everything comes downstream from Him."
