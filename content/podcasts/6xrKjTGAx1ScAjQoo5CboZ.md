description: "Our actions— or inaction— will affect generations to come, so we must take what God has given us and treasure it, making it our top priority. With each opportunity God opens for us, we must be like the man who found the pearl of great price; we must do all we can to pursue it. Our faith and obedience must be proven. We cannot be satisfied being a spectator. Hold onto what God has given you and be steadfast."
