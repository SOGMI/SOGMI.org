description: "In this episode, Pastor Cristina discusses a vision she had about this country as well as what we should come to expect in this coming year. Once the Body of Christ is in position, once we fully put our trust in Him, He will put His enemies into derision. We should expect displacements, replacements, promotions and demotions. Make yourself ready!"
