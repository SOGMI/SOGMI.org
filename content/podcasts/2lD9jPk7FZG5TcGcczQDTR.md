description: "The condition of the country reflects the condition of the church, so ask yourself, \"where do you stand and what must you do to advance the kingdom of God?\" Have you been maturing and discipling others in the Body of Christ to be mature? Or have you become distracted with your own desires and anger towards those you feel deserve judgment? God is looking for us to change the tide, not decide who deserves judgment, so release any of your preconceptions and hatred towards others and take on the heart of God and have a willing attitude. Are you ready to take on this responsibility?"
