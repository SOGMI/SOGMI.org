description: "The differentiator between those of us that will fall by the wayside and those that will change the world is obedience. We must be more than just talk. We do not need to worry about establishing or proving ourselves but just obeying and following God every step of the way; He will take care of the rest. Fretting over things will only open the door for causing us to stumble, and our obedience or disobedience has more ripples than we can imagine. Let us not be led into sin because of insecurity or convenience. Let us choose this day to obey the Lord"
