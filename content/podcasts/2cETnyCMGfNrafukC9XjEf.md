description: "In the race set before us, we have made it to the qualifications, but now the real race begins. We must be the best we can be, wherever God has placed us, because we are there for a reason. He is preparing you for what is to come. Focus on spending that time with God, and uniting under Christ and overlooking our differences. Let us meditate on what God has given us and move forward!"
