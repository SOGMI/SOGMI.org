description: "God's purpose will be fulfilled, whether you are a part of it or not. Remember the seven thousand who had not bowed their knees to Baal, those that were set aside and ready to be used by God; do not think that God's plans will wait on you. So let us remain steadfast and take up our Post. The victory has already been handed to us.\n"
