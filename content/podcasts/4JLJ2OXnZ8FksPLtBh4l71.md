description: "God has been greatly grieved by the opinions, hatred, and unforgiveness that has been coming from His people. Remember that God does not enjoy the punishment of the wicked, so we must not hope for their destruction, but should have the heart of God and pray for the wicked. We cannot continue to spread anger and hatred as if we do not have hope in Jesus Christ. Instead, let us get busy preparing for what lies ahead and meditating on the promises of God. Great things are coming if we make Christ the true Lord of our lives. We cannot continue to work God around our schedules, but should instead work our schedule around God. Let us get excited!"
