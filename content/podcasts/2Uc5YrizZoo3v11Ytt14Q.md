description: "You can have a form of spirituality, but that does not mean you are acting out the will of God. We should let the Holy Spirit and His word be our guide. Let us continue to meditate on the words God has released over us. True prophecy always reveals something about the nature of God, points to Christ, and points the way to God's master plan. Let us remember that things happen in the spiritual realm first, and then the natural will follow, so we cannot let ourselves get distracted by what we think may or may not be happening. We must not let ourselves be reactionary."
