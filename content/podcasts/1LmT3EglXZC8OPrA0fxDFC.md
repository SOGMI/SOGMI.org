description: "In this episode Pastor Mike talks about spiritual authority and how it differs from the authority in the world. Rather than a top down structure, spiritual authority is bottom up; it begins with service. Ultimately, the foundation of spiritual authority is serving the Lord and being led by him. It is about holding others up, not lording over them."
