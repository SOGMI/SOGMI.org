description: "Listen in as Pastor Cristina talks about our upcoming event, the Prophetic Gathering of The Saints, and some lessons we can learn about prophecy. We have to seek out that personal relationship with Him. We need to think of God and His reputation as we act, and we need to ask Him what we can do. We are going to Leap into the supernatural, so focus on the promises of God."
