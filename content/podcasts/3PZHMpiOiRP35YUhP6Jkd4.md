description: "Wherever God is leading you, you must take a step of faith forward. We must always be sensitive to His leading.  And remember, blessings are not the goal, but a side effect of obeying God. The goal should always be to build up His kingdom. Things have been reset, and in a reset both the good and the bad have been done away with, so let us continue to look ahead instead of behind. Greater is still to come!"
