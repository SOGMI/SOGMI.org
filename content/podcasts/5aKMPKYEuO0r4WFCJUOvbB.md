description: "In this episode Pastor Josh talks about how, despite how the situations look or the laws that might be made, God has a perfect plan and can turn around any situation for His purpose, no matter how impossible they seem. We see this throughout the book of Esther, where God placed both Esther and Haman in the perfect position before anything unfolded. In the same way, God is preparing and placing His people now, but we must prioritize Him and step into our calling; if we do not, someone else will fulfill it in our place."
