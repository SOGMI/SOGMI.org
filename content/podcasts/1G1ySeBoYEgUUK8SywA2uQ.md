description: "The equipping of the Body of Christ in these last days is going to be different than previous preparation... to allow the Body of Christ to be able to focus on our Lord Jesus Christ and to implement His ways of doing things in every area of our lives and in every sector of society, not just in the four walls of our ministry buildings."
