description: "We have to be willing to rearrange everything in our lives for the calling God has placed on our lives. God does not call people at their own convenience. When we submit to His plan, God will take care of all those things that concern us. So let us take what God has given us and run with it. The people that go all in are the ones that will establish and build up the kingdom of God and move in power."
