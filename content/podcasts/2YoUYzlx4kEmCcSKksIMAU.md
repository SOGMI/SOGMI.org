god bless you for tuning in hello this is Cristina Sosso of Freedom fellowship church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time glory to God political revival is here in the United States of America that will impact the whole world first of all I would like to thank you my dear brothers and sisters in Christ for following the prophetic instruction contained in the prophecy that if the people of God will unite and will not engage in political arguments divisiveness or hatred and will vote for righteousness that we will experience political revival here in the United States of America and this is important at the same time the transfer of wealth influence and affluence will manifest to those that are righteous and faithful in the bed of Christ it is important that we should remember that this is one of those times thank God that the people of God United and we have become the largest voting bloc in the country no color no denomination barrier that Jesus became our unifying force in our language is love and now as our new president-elect is calling for unity and the body of Christ is already United you watch my dear brothers and sisters of the greater things ahead keep in mind your future is a lot greater more prosperous better than your past the one thing that we need to do is to let go and forgive and let us be a part of the healing of the nation in proverbs 24 verse 17 says do not gloat when your enemy Falls when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice even Jesus said in Luke chapter 10 verse 20 when the disciples came back and and they found out that they can raise the dead they can heal the sick even the demons obeyed them in Luke chapter 10 verse 20 Jesus said however do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven in first Corinthians chapter 13 verse 6 says love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth Psalm 34 15 the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry it is important for us to be grateful to be thankful that God is a merciful God that he gave this country an opportunity and I'm going to discuss more about what to expect and you need to prepare just like I have been preparing freedom fellowship charts and the connections that we have in other parts of the world I've been

start at 6:30 in the evening and probably dinner will be served at about 7:00 or 7:30 you don't want to miss this important event okay so the condition of the political revival in this country was the people of God has to unite and if we vote for righteousness so we voted as Christians first and we voted as Americans second which is good and I want you to understand and remind yourself that God has a greater plan for United States of America and the glory of the United States of America is about ready to be revealed for the whole world and at the same time the body of Christ will begin to emerge as a powerful and influential church the nameless faceless people that have cleaned themselves and are faithful and righteous before a holy God they are now in position and we continue to increase in number for the transfer of influence and affluence and I<split> want to read to you Daniel chapter 4 verse 17 I read it to the congregation before the election it's an NIV it's about the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar but I want you to look at who God is and how powerful he is he still on the throne in Daniel chapter 4 verse 17 it says the decision is announced by messengers the holy one declare the verdict so that the living may know that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men see that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men he's still on the throne every time I meditate on the prophecies God released for the body of Christ for this nation the prophecies he personally gave me my head swims all the time if I do not receive this prophecies by faith I will not be able to contain and even remember the instructions contained in those prophecies they're just too good they're heavenly things so things that are of the Spirit are spiritually discerned this is the reason why I will be sharing things with you on November 19th and our address is at 80 419 Callahan Road off IH 10 so I offer this conference as my seed to the state of Texas and a love offering to God so but seating is limited okay so you have to register ASAP at SOG mi dot org it's going to be awesome so I want to repeat this prophecy again to you because it is really part of the transfer of wealth remember the prophecy what the Lord says when the political revival will manifest and it will be for everyone for the whole world to see and they will not be able to explain how it happened and nobody can claim anything that this is the move of God and they're gonna find out and they're going to realize it's the Christian who have become influential in the church see a part of our blessing is whatever we place our hands to it shall prosper according to the book of Deuteronomy so we should not touch any and clean things because they will prosper so let us focus on the good things on the godly things so that they will also prosper so one morning at about 357 in the morning the Lord woke me up and he started talking to me about his plan for this season he gave me specific instruction one of the instructions is this he told me Cristina do not limit me walk into every open door of opportunities I open for you and specifically believe do not lean in your own understanding but in all your ways of knowledge me and I shall direct your path when God emphasized and told me that not to lean on my own understanding it means that a lot of things that he will open up or give me a revelation it's something that I have not encountered before or I have not done before and it's not good on the flesh that I will not be able to pick ways and means how God will answer my prayer so I went and I still go through all the doors of opportunities that he is opening without asking any question or complaining and I'm still walking through all those open doors and it's really changing me I share this with a bat of Christ at freedom for sup charts so that they can play this prophecy for themselves and so that they can follow instruction after all we are all a part of the body of Christ since that time I have experienced so many things in which some of them are hard on the flesh but my faith is getting built up and God is pleased and he continues to open doors of opportunities for me for the congregation for those people who believed for my entire family so anyone who meditate on this promise this is big I am experienced such anointing and understanding on the plan of God and I am going to speak to you more about this election do you know that God spoke to me about this in 2000 yes he started revealing things to me in the year 1999 and 2000 and I'm gonna share that with you at the conference thank you lord I am going to delve more on prophecies until the November 19 prophetic conference so that I can prepare those who are attending and at the same time sharing this with you our listeners whomsoever who believe and follow the instruction contained in the prophecies will be blessed beyond measure and the one thing that you need to understand about the nature of our God even if the prophecy is a correction or shall we say judgment his motivation is always love he is a merciful God and he always provide a way out of any given situations that a lot of times we cause ourselves he is ready to forgive he is so loving so let us go back to the prophetic dream of King Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel chapter 4 verse 19 starting with verse 19 it says then Daniel also called Balthus Yasir was greatly perplexed for a time and his thoughts terrified him so the king said Belteshazzar do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you belteshazzar answered my lord if only the dream applied to your<split> enemies and its meaning to your adversaries the tree you saw which grew large and strong would stop touching the sky visible to the whole earth with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit providing food for all giving shelter to the beasts of the field and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air you Oh king are the three you have become great and strong your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky and your dominion extends the distant parts of the earth down to verse 24 I'm reading from Daniel chapter 4 now we're in verse 24 this is the interpretation o king and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king you will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven seven times will pass by for you this is the condition until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules therefore O king be pleased to accept my advice renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed it may be that your prosperity will continue down to verse 33 immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled he was driven away from the people an eighth grass like cattle his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird at the end of that time I never cut Nasr raised my eye toward heaven and my sanity was restored then I praised the Most High I honored and glorified him who lives forever his Dominion is an eternal Dominion his kingdom endures from generation to generation down to verse 36 at the same time that my sanity was restored my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom my advisors and nobles sought me out and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before this is important for us to realize when God spoke about political revival we were thinking some of us were thinking that okay God is going to do this God is going to do that and we wanted God to do things or to manifest things based on our own understanding but in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 27 it says that again God is going to shake the heavens and the earth and anything that can be shaken will be shaken so that the things of God shall remain so the foundation of our political system and how it was controlled and manipulated by only few and the people of God the American people most of us have been overlooked and nothing is done people are restless and people are just barely making it and when God said that there will be political revival he's going to do something that we don't expect that we cannot explain away that nobody can take a credit except it's going to be that God's people will be used by God corporately so the world doesn't know what to do so I just want you to realize that here in this earth there are two kingdoms that are operating the kingdom of the Most High God and the Kingdom of the world and remember there is a scripture in Revelation it says for the kingdom of the world has now become the kingdom of our Lord and of Christ and we are that Christ the baloff Christ so this is the beginning of the many things that we have never witnessed before in the history of the church and in the history of this country if you dare to believe this is a move of God so therefore we cannot lean on our own understanding but we have to allow the Holy Spirit to lead us to give us an understanding and to show us his plan and we have to continue to ask God to increase our capacity to receive our capacity to believe and strength to obey those are important and with Daniel chapter 4 God if he is not merciful if he is not a God of restoration he could have just replaced King Nebuchadnezzar he could just replace it if God is going to ask me or asked you you know we can we can provide a simple solution but how can we provide a simple solution in this world where in things are spiritual God has to make the plans and he always plan big so by being merciful since Nebuchadnezzar hardened his heart and he did not listen to prophet Daniel to repent and to make the necessary correction so he went through that he went through the process he ate grass like cattle he lost his mind actually but as soon as he acknowledged God his sanity was restored back to him and at the same time his kingdom was restored back to him who can better preach the gospel of good news than a king who has authority and who has such a podium but with us we would want God to kill Nebuchadnezzar and replace him with the<split> righteous one so neat and so tidy but God has a perfect plan his ways are excellent and perfect and they are bigger and so is God's plan upon your life we just entered a season of harvest for the church this is the most awesome year even though I worked hard even though I have schedules upon schedules of the things that needs to be done even though my spirit is so excited because God has been showing me this for many many years now and they're finally coming to pass see what is God telling you I'm pretty sure all of you have received personal prophecies they are word from God and they will never proven false I know that by just watching everything that is happening in this country and God gave me a glimpse and he even make me a part of this great move I am very very grateful and humbled for that so there is hope the actually there is such a greater hope for all of us in the body of Christ this is the most exciting times we are entering the most exciting times in the history of the church and since we have never been this way before we need to ask the Holy Spirit to guide us jesus promised us in John that when the Holy Spirit will come he will guide us into all truth and what else he will tell us things to come that's prophecy he was going to give us a prophecy so that we have a heads up on what he's going to do so that we will not panic so that we will not give in to pressure so that we will look even our own challenges as opportunities to strengthen our faith to bring forth the character and to prove God's workings in us in all of us so I just wanted to encourage you if God had mercy on King Nebuchadnezzar so much more with us his children when he looks at you he sees Jesus he doesn't look at your fault because Jesus paid for those faults and mistakes and he erased them so when God the Father looks at you he looks at the perfect man who is in Christ Jesus so it is important for us to do this and to believe and if you say well answers like Cristina that is in the Old Covenant remember I kept on telling you that anything that prophesy about the charts about the Messiah those are universal truth and the the Old Testament also provide a glimpse of a loving and the perfect plan of God that's universal it shows the characteristics of our God so keep that in mind you have to eat if it's too good to be true you need to believe it and receive it by faith okay let me give you a scripture in the New Testament so that you will know in Luke chapter 1 so that you will believe it looked chapter 1 starting with verse 5 it says in the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron both of them were upright in the sight of God observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly but they had no children because Elizabeth was barren and they were both well along in years let's go down to verse 11 then the angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense when Zechariah saw him he was startled and was gripped with fear but the angel said to him do not be afraid Zechariah your prayer has been heard your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to give him the name John so it is important for us to note here is Zachariah who has been praying for him and his wife to have a son a child and all of a sudden here it is after many years the angel appeared to him and said your prayer has been heard and said your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to give him the name John he will be a joy and delight to you and many will rejoice because of his birth what a prophecy what an answered prayer but down to verse 18 it says Zechariah asked the angel how can I be sure of this I am an old man and my wife is well along in years the angel answered I am Gabriel I stand in the presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news and now you will be silent and unable to speak under the day this happens because you did not believe my words which will come true at their proper time here is Zechariah a priest who knew the word it was praying to have a child and when God finally answered his prayer because he was leaning to his own understanding he was saying the angel Gabriel appeared to him he said how can I be sure of this I'm an old man and my wife is well along in years he was operating in and belief here we are we're praying to God for something good and when it finally happens or or or when God confirm it and then you don't believe many prophecies and many things are as the plan of God unfolds for your life and for your future they are too good they are so good and they're so big and they're so grand that you need to exercise your faith to receive<split> them and then to meditate on them day and night and follow the simple instructions contained in those prophecies Zacharias instruction you will call him John it's as simple as that he can do that he's the father and he's a priest so God knows your heart and let us know the heart of God this is what the November 19 prophetic conference is all about we were going to know the true heart of our God to hear his voice to do His perfect will for the great plan for your life to unfold and I'm running out of time
