description: "This week I’m going to be continuing a series that I started a couple of weeks ago about the journey that we as believers are going through right now… I talked about how when we begin our journey to the promised land, God begins with giving us a call. Just like with Abraham… he didn't know where he was going. He didn’t know the destination. He just knew that God was calling him out from his father’s household, and that’s something that’s very distinct about the calling that God has for us because the call will always require us to step out of our comfort zone."
