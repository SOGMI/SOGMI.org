description: "We need to get busy about the Father's business and focus on the mission God has given us. Intercede for those that are lost, because it is God's desire that all men be saved. We must pray for our leaders, regardless of where they stand. It is up to the Body of Christ to turn this nation around, so humble yourself before the Lord, and get on God's side. "
