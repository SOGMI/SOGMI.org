description: "Pastor Cristina is back from the Philippines reporting the great things accomplished and prophecies to the nations! The seeds we have sown will reap a harvest of righteousness for our country. We must continue to focus on God's promises and not get distracted by the upheavals happening all over the world; these things must happen as God is positioning the nations of the world. Remember, we are in this world, but we are not of it, so let the wicked continue to do wicked, and the righteous continue to do righteous."
