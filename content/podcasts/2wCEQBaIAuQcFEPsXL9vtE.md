description: "Building up a personal relationship with God is the secret to following God's call on your life. Fall in love with Jesus all over again, and allow the Holy Spirit to be your teacher. Then we will be blessed to be a blessing. Greater works are here, but it is only by our faith and action that we can do this.\n"
