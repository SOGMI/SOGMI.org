description: "Have you been seeking God out, or just following your own routine? God is looking for those that are willing and eager to seek Him out and obey Him; that is the determining factor for leadership in the Body of Christ. It is not us but God who chooses who is appointed and anointed, so let us work to see others and see ourselves how He sees us. God does not care about your age, gender and race. He cares about your heart and obedience. Let us be one of those that makes themselves available for God. Let us not let these opportunities be passed on to the next generation."
