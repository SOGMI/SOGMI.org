description: "There are a lot of doors of opportunity open, but we must unite in heart and purpose and do the will of God in this election. This country is going to turn around into righteousness, let us make sure is on our watch. Anointing and greater power and revelation is being poured out onto those who are willing to change and are willing to let go of their past and move forward. No one but you can disqualify or qualify yourself. "
