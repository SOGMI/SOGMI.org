description: "We are not bound by our circumstances but by our own faith and obedience to God. When darkness comes, we must speak light. If we have not been seeing signs and wonders it is because we have not been exercising our faith. The things that God has told us, we must treat them as if they have already manifested. We must walk our faith, not just for our own sake, but also for the sake of the nations. We must have faith and be fully equipped to engage properly in spiritual warfare. Just like in wartime, we must always be alert and ready so that God can direct us at any time."
