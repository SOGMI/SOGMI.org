description: "Like Moses with the making of the tabernacle, we must follow the pattern God has set before us, down to even the smallest of details. We may not know exactly how God is going to do things, but by following His instructions step by step, great things will come to fruition. Let us continue to purify ourselves, and make ourselves ready, because God is about ready to do great things, but we must be prepared in order to be a part of it and we must follow the pattern He has laid out for us."
