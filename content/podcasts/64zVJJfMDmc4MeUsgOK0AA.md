hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom fellowship church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time Wow summer the best summer ever for the body of Christ 2016 is the most awesome and exciting year for the charts take advantage of it believe and receive this season is so profitable it is going to be productive and so anointed it's a wonderful time I am so joyfully busy I'm talking about real productive business God has to tell me to rest you know when I get something going sometimes I do not know when to stop to the point of exhaustion so I'm learning to yield and to stop when God tells me to rest and the stop this season I witnessed the manifestations of prophecies being fulfilled and I'm presently beginning to get a deeper understanding of the intent purpose and the heart of God prophecies are being fulfilled but of Christ personal prophecies prophecies to the nation's and prophecy to the church as long as you follow the instruction and you remember your prophecy you need to jump on board and and apply God's ways of doing things and in every areas of your life you were going to get blessed in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 19 through 21 says and we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the morning star rises in your hearts above all you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about the prophets own interpretation for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit it says we have the word of the prophets and we will do well to pay attention to the prophecy like a flashlight in the dark place so that you can see where you're going you know the world is getting darker but we are not a part of this world we belong to a different family we belong to the family of God and I always explain that prophecies when it says thus saith the Lord and as long as you follow the if if you believe if you don't fear if you put me first those are conditions as long as you follow those conditions God will bring things to pass because even when there are times that were unfaithful he remains faithful because that's who he is so prophecies we do not defend them we don't need to defend them from Satan and said as long as we believe actually prophecies are supposed to be our weapons for its pitiful warfare because as long as they have not manifested yet all good things come from God so it means to say that you're okay because you meditate on your prophecies day and night and you meditate on the things of God day and night you're going to get great success that's what the scripture says and that's what God promised you know it took about more than 12 years for the transfer of wealth influence and affluence to manifest it took that much preparation for the body of Christ to apply God's ways of doing things it started in 2004 for me okay I was praying and the Lord spoke to me and showed me lots of wonderful things he said that revival is coming to the United States of America and this revival will eclipse what the Lord did during the Sousa Street revival in nine you know three through 1906 because of the times and the season the church is about to enter into that was in 2004 and before the late Kenneth Hagin went to be with the Lord the Lord allowed him to see this year the Lord allowed him to see the season he said heaven on earth he cannot even described it in English at that time so when I read about that in I think 2007 I got so excited because God always confirm his word from the mouth of two or more and now all the prophets all God's prophets are echoing the same thing this is a good season this is a season of open doors this is the most blessed the most anointed season that we're entering in in 2004 the Lord asked me what did not manifest during the Susa Street revival and I pondered about this and being a former banker I said that transfer of wealth I read books about the Susa Street and during the hundred year celebration we were in Los Angeles to celebrate with the body of Christ there I was then instructed to start business school and training school which I continued even this day also in 1906 Wayne Seymour the black Minister whom God used during the Seuss's Street revival keep this in mind this was 1906 and God used a black minister during the time of segregation so what is the impossibility or the situation that you're involved with that you think that God cannot manifest what he promised in your life this was 1906 and God said that I don't care about segregation anyway I am a holy God I'll do what I please so he used Wayne Seymour so in 1906 reverend wayne seymour prophesied that God will grant United<split> States of America revival in a hundred I know that God is not just going to visit but he will abide and will anoint and bless his people and be active in their lives until we make his enemies his footstool that was the scripture so if you are one of the eschatology Zoar the end times when is Jesus coming back Psalm 110 verse 1 the Lord says to my lord sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet this is also in Luke chapter 20 verse 43 Acts chapter 2 verse 35 and Hebrews 1:13 so when is the Lord coming back when the church is at the helm when the church has Dominion when the church is ruling and reigning reigning here on earth with Jesus Christ when the church is one with Christ Jesus that's when Jesus is coming back do you understand me so let the world continue to do what they do but let the righteous continue the righteous things and let the righteous continue to be holy that was commanded to us by Lord Jesus Christ and he repeated it again in Revelation the book of Revelation so do not focus on the doom and gloom of our times these are exciting times we have the flashlight so don't look and focus on the doom and gloom use the prophecies even the prophecy for the church in the book of Revelation that God has created us to be kings and priests not kings or priest but kings and priests to rule and reign with him here on the earth so you want the rapture to come now you're missing it big time you have a job to do you have to take your post God is leading you now to a wealthy place you have been through the fire you've been through the flood and now God the Lord God is now leading you to a wealthy place that's where the body of Christ is heading so come on board back to the transfer of wealth influence and affluence for the team you know I've been talking about this almost every year but it became more intense starting in 2014 2014 2015 and now it's 2016 and the Lord instructed me that keep on teaching them keep on making the way for them keep on prophesying to them and said and those who believe things will start manifesting and the Lord told me that as soon as I did that to train and to continue to train the people those who will listen ok then he gave me the green light to start my own the Lord gave me business concepts in 1989 before Mike and I got married when I just started in the ministry and I called it at that time Joseph's project and now it's implementation of the Moses ways of doing things was not going to leave anything behind we're not going to leave or open the door for the resources for the world to take it in I called it the Moses concept so now 2016 has come and since September of 2014 the Lord started talking to me about me about what he is planning on doing in every areas of my life and I discussed this with the Lord many many times I did some changes many many times but in the end I always remind God that I will pick him I will choose his ways of doing things at the end of the day at the beginning of the day anytime and everywhere anywhere so now the transfer of wealth influence and affluence has come to the core team who have believed and who was able to handle Corrections and throwing things that they learned in the past and learning new and they are in love with God they're just such a powerful group of people and you look at them they don't talk that much but we are right in the smacking center of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence I was able to place some of them and things are manifesting now even in the SAS of family glory to God I just wanted to share this with you so that you will understand the season that we're in you need to take hold of your instruction the prophetic instruction that you received and the Holy Spirit will remind you of them jump on board before it's too late okay so that when you look back a few months from now a few years from now you don't have any regrets do the best that you can and always do the right thing so it was my target that beginning the summer things will begin to manifest big time and they have been manifesting glory to God Landen and Alexa just got married last week and Ed and Sylvia are about ready to move to their new house Sylvia's post in the transfer of wealth is already solid it's up to her and Ed if they're going to pursue it or not so God has already placed them and they were willing to do so Nicole is already versus and it's just a matter of time and Joshua is operating two businesses which will turn into about five or six corporations in the future and James also the brothers James and Joshua Sosso are now operating in one business and James will continue to be active in that even while in college Erica god gave Erica a business concept so that she can support herself while she's attending college same<split> thing with Joshua drew will have his own business even before he graduates from high school these are our young people okay and Coby is about ready to get in there same thing with the rest of the group I'm enjoying working with them every day you know I've been working I've been working seven days a week and most of them are working seven days a week but we're having a wonderful time so in the next few weeks I'm going to add more to the group those who will listen and also going to believe God also be healed instead of insisting on their own way we're going to have a big meeting and training at the same time and I am personally involved in forming this corporations and partnerships and businesses and when they can operate on their own then I will attend to my own interest amazing I'm enjoying the best time of my life I never seen this much manifestation in such a short period of time and I've been in the ministry for a long long time I've been in the prophetic ministry for a long long time and if somebody will tell me and said no you're not prophetic it's too late for that okay and if you believe it's too late for the devil to cause any disaster in your life so you need to come you need to join the ranks and take our post the Bride of Christ is going to be known as a glorious and influential Church in our time so even though we're practically working seven days a week everybody's excited at freedom faucet charts and if somebody don't apply God's ways of doing things I just let them I just let them go to the world and try it and then they'll come back anyway but this group of people especially including our young people they have been under training all these years and now they are matured in the spirit and are capable enough to handle and manage wealth so if they will be which I know they will they will be a good steward they will be faithful then God will entrust them all of us with true riches Luke chapter 16 verses 10 to 12 whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much so if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will trust you with true riches this is our Lord Jesus Christ asking us this if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will entrust you with the true riches the transfer of wealth is a major part in proving if the body of Christ or if the members of the body of Christ can be trusted with worldly wealth before he will entrust us with the true riches let's continue verse 12 I'm reading from Luke chapter 16 starting with verse 10 verse 12 and if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property who will give you a property of your own so do not take advantage somebody and do not trash somebody else's place even business so our vision or our target for the team is to be wealthy so that we will all serve and honor God with our wealth that is the main criteria not just doing our own thing not just doing it our own way no it is to serve and honor God with those wealth verse 13 no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both God and money you know when the real estate market collapse in the late 80s I saw that collapse coming at least two years before it happened God gave me a vision and it happened but that same economic or real estate collapse opened opportunities for the BOD of Christ to own some real estate to those that have been ready and we're not operating in the world system we seize those opportunities and we own real estate I got my house through the real estate auction and again in 2003 I'm just sharing some of the things that I prophesied that God asked me to prophesy or to release the bat of Christ so that you will put two and two together okay so in 2003 God told me that the price of gold will soar it will go so high at that time the price of gold between 210 to 230 announced and I told a few people in the group those who had the money to invest in those times one did not do it one did the person who did it is my husband Mike unfortunately Mike sold the gold before they reached their peak of their prices he made some money but if he just waited for further instruction he could have made a whole lot more see we have to wait for the timing of God we cannot operate in anything else we cannot panic we cannot fear we cannot be suspicious or anything or we cannot afford to operate in greed I'm talking to you members of the body of Christ we have to put our trust in God and we have to obey when he tells us to do something so this season is one of those seasons that this generation will never forget this generation please hear me will not get another<split> opportunity like this if we miss this one yes God is going to restore you God go continue to forgive God is going to restore but I'm talking about an opportunity of a lifetime this is nothing in comparison to your success in the past if you believe in obey you will be blessed beyond measure in every area of your life we need to follow the instruction to the letter and let us not assume or presume anything in this season it is so exciting see the drama is now being removed in the bed of Christ now that the drama and performances are not working anymore now we can see that dramatic results are manifesting so if you are al pastor stop the performances stop the drama or tell your congregation no drama but let us expect dramatic results for this season we need to learn to adjust we need to be teachable and we need to yield the leading of the Holy Spirit because we've never been this way before it is here but of Christ it is really here turn your eyes on Jesus and focus on him let me end this in first Corinthians chapter 2 first Corinthians chapter 2 starting with verse 1 when I came to you brothers I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God for I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified I came to you in weakness and fear and with much trembling my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirits power so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom but on God's power did you hear that we do however speak a message of wisdom among the mature but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age were coming to nothing anything that the church have been practicing and had been following steps in ways that are off the world and they just Spritle eyes it they are coming to nothing please hear me out verse 7 no we speak of God's secret wisdom a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began this secret wisdom from God is for the mature those who are yielded and obedient those who are faithful they were hidden from the world and from the immature because now it is our destiny that God is going to glorify us and that is his plan remember what jesus prayed in John and said now father it is time for you to glorify me we are the body of Christ and we imitate Jesus Christ for the righteous for the obedient for the faithful you can say now Lord in this transfer of wealth influence influence glorify me Holy Father in the mighty name of Jesus so that I can honor and glorify you so instructions that we received instructions I released through this broadcast they are from God it will do well with you to listen to pray and follow through and know I am NOT going to sit down with you and hold your hands and prophesy to you and all this if you have not responded to training which I've been calling out time and time and time again and said I will not do that I am so busy right now in placing God's people in the transfer of wealth and I'm working with them and we're having a wonderful time no counseling ask the Holy Spirit to teach you instead wisdom that God released in our group several weeks ago several weeks ago we witnessed Chains and transformation even in our own minds in our hearts and in our own lives I'm teaching the younger group finances to be a good steward this summer and they are excited you know they're easier to disciple actually because they believe and I'm running out of time again god bless you I just wanted to tell you that my motivation when I chop your head off when I beat the daylights out of you through this broadcast when I skin you alive you need a new wineskin anyway my motivation is to provoke you and to shake you into taking your post in the kingdom of God because I don't want anyone to regret this that they should have believed they should have done something it is time that I am calling all hands on deck everybody has to be involved alright god bless you for tuning in
