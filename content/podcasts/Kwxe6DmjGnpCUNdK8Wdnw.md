description: "As leaders, we must transition away from our own concerns and needs and towards the needs of others.  We must continually go back into the presence of the Lord and continue receiving His instructions. This should be our model in ministry, in business, and in our personal lives. We must take responsibility of our own faith walk; we must individually press in and hear from God and we must guard the vision God has given us and make sure it is executed exactly as it was given. We cannot offload things to someone else; let us carry out what He has given us to do."
