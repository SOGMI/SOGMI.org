description: "For any Christian to be a part of the transfer of wealth, influence and affluence, we need to be a financier of the great commission. You need to be a sower, not just a reaper. Wealth is set for us to be a blessing to nations, to finance the preaching of the gospel all over the world and to make disciples. It is a principle of the kingdom of our God: as long as the Earth endures, there is seedtime and harvest (Genesis 8:22). And Galatians 6:7-8 “Do not be deceived, God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction. The one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.” In order to be a blessing to nations, we need to start sowing where we’re at and we need to start sowing now. Give cheerfully. Honor your commitment once made, and believe God for the provision, and always be led by the Holy Spirit.\n\n "
