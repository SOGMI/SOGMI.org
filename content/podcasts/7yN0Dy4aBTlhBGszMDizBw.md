description: "These forty days are important in our preparation for the things ahead. We must be willing to unlearn the things we used to do and allow the Holy Spirit to teach us new things. Be slow to anger and slow to speak. Remember that it is as much as we can receive, as much as we can believe, and as much as we can handle. But it always starts with the issues of the heart, so we must make ourselves ready and take responsibility. Put your faith in God alone. Take courage and take your stand."
