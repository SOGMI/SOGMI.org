description: "We must not react to what is going on around us; the Lord never reacted. God is holy and just, He will correct, discipline, and love His people just as He will expose false prophets, it is not our job to do so. We as the body of Christ, Prophets and Apostles especially, must be kingdom minded, we do not need to be political. We should not mock or give our opinions but focus on the promises of God and what we must do."
