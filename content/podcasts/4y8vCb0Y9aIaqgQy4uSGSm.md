God bless you for tuning in hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom fellowship church and sons of God international and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time you know what this is going to be a first time ever we are celebrating the Passover on April 22nd Friday at the Hilton Garden Hotel on IH 10 at the rim this is the first time ever that I would not cook I will not prepare the food I will not decorate for the Passover I will not know what to do with myself of course the year 2016 is the beginning of many beginnings and this is a first I will have all the time in the world so we will have the most wonderful time with Jesus I am so excited so what I'm going to do because I don't have to cook I don't have to work I don't have to do anything I am going to isolate myself for the first few days before the events so I'll be more than ready it's going to be the first time ever that also the attendees will pay for their dinner that's a first for the past several years freedom force of charts and the core team pooled our resources together and we offer it to everybody for free now glory to God 2016 is a good year I will concentrate on Spritle things and of course on what am I going to wear it's going to be a formal affair if you're planning on attending and it's going to be $50.00 per person so if you want to join us give us a call at two one zero six nine five one six three zero or you can go to our website at SOG mi dot org and you can register and pay so we will eat the traditional lamp unleavened bread but the celebration will not be based on the Jewish Passover celebration we celebrate Passover under the new covenant Jesus Christ front and center Jesus our Passover new things better things coming our way glory to God in Luke chapter 22 verse 19 in Matthew 26 verse 26 jesus celebrated the last Passover with his disciples before he was arrested and he broke bread with them and he says in Luke chapter 20 19 and matthew 26:26 is when you do this when you break bread together in celebrating the passover do this in remembrance of me so we're following what he commands we are required to celebrate the passover ok so it's going to be awesome last week two weeks after my trip in the philippines the ladies prepared a gourmet meal for me at Debra's beautiful home and everything is well thought up it's just a wonderful wonderful dinner the decorations the flowers the food of course the food was prepared by me and see she prepared us a gourmet meal and Deborah prepared the dessert of course and it was an awesome event we were there for 6 hours but it seemed like we were sitting there talking for only 2 hours everything is perfect I was so happy I do not have to minister to anyone I do not have to pray for anyone we sat down ate our dinner and we talked about Jesus and all the great things he has done and about ready to do I decided to discuss about the love of God today and for the next several weeks because I am walking in a certain level with God and I tend to take for granted simple but powerful message about the love of God I assumed that everybody is experiencing God the way I did but when each of the core team the ladies shared what touched them the most for my teachings from this ministry I was stunned of the many different things they got things they gleaned from the teachings and the revelation that transformed their lives but all of them pointed towards the love of God so I endeavor not to give you the whole counsel of God in one program but to take you step by step that will propel you higher in 2016 I might skin you alive once in a while but the focus and my motivation is to take you with me to the most exciting time of your life with Jesus as a Christian so for the next few weeks I will be teaching you how to move in the power of God I will be discussing with you about the love of God the Word of God the authority of the believer and anointing we're going to revisit all of those major topics it is high time that we in the body of Christ move in power so make it your confession every day this prophecy for 2016 and beyond and make it personal so repeat after me in 2016 I will look good I will feel good I will live good I will be good I was sound good and I will do good all for the glory of God for my own benefit and for the benefit of his people amen doesn't that sound wonderful so let me go back to the topic of today the love of God I mentioned to you two weeks ago how I was affected or overwhelmed after the business conference and the prophetic gathering of the Saints in the Philippines I was so overwhelmed how God moved and how the leaders about 1500 of them received the message it was overwhelming for me see my dear brothers and sisters I did not fast I did not pray before the event I hardly prepared for this<split> gathering one reason is that we have held prophetic gatherings before here in the United States sometimes with hundreds of people in attendance many times less than a hundred and sometimes less than fifty the most that I personally prayed and prophesied to pastors and ministers is about 550 pastors I prayed and prophesied to each and every one of them and after that event I was so tired so I did not know how to prepare for thousands of people in attendance and physically I cannot see how I will be able to do it but I reminded myself on how the Holy Spirit touched and slained hundreds and thousands of people in our miracle Crusades and leadership trainings they were all piled up on top of each other so I did not even try to figure things out I took yes I took my notes I studied and I picked some scriptures that's all I did I had my notes on all the events but I did not use 80 to 85% of those notes one of the biggest event is the business conference this conference was held for the purpose of preparing and training God's people for the transfer of wealth it was the last big event in the city and as soon as I took the microphone the Lord changed the mess and for the next five and a half hours I spoke ministered prophesied and nobody moved and I dare say that it is the most anointed event last month I did not do anything all I did is to show up and yielded to the leading of the Holy Spirit and all of God's people in attendance fell in love with Jesus all over again you could see it in their faces they were in fire for the things of God alone in my hotel room I was so overwhelmed with what I saw with what I experienced I have held many conferences and I can truly say that God moved in all of our events but this was different because the year that we are in the move of God is far stronger it is more glorious because it is the season where the plan of God was shared to his people I did not do anything I told God in that hotel room I cannot sleep I don't know how to calm myself I felt that I do not deserve this position that I was in so I told God and said Lord I feel that I do not deserve this position of glory you require so little of me and yet you have given me so so much I was really crying with joy I did not know what to do with myself that night and through the early morning I ministered before God and then he told me Christina I used to Mythili and I will continue to use you because I love you and you love me back and you have love for my people the tenderness of the Holy Spirit was so overwhelming the Lord reassured me that I deserved to be in my position because he is the one who appointed me I did not appoint myself in John chapter 15 verse 16 says you did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last then the father will give you whatever you ask in my name and I asked God something important to me last year and he manifested that request he answered my prayer and gave me much much more in Romans chapter five verse eight says but God demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were sinners Christ died for us my dear brothers and sisters whatever you do there is no way that you can earn his love he loved you first and settled in your heart with that truth don't look at the facts don't look at your failings don't look up to all the turmoil all around us but settle on the truth settle on John 15:16 you did not choose him but he chose you and he demonstrated his love for us that while we were sinners he died for us he already called you so you cannot earn that love you can try but you don't have to he loved you first instead receive his love receive him and accept him as your Lord and Savior he is so good from my experience with God and my knowledge of who he is I want to encourage you to believe on what he is saying to you he loves you I want to encourage you to receive and meditate on his promises to you get to know him and his character and then learn of his ways of doing things and apply them to your everyday life what do I do before big events such as the conference's what I learned is to yield and to rest in him I yield myself and I allow the holy spirit to lead do not consider yourself or your reputation because it will lead to doubt or it will lead to pride instead allow God to use you and be one with him on that podium that day I was given words to say some examples to give for every major topic or talking points right there on the stage and I had a wonderful time and for five and a half hours I ministered and I did not even look at my notes the Holy Spirit took over I yielded and he he was more than willing to touch his people through me in first John chapter 4 starting with verse 13 all the way through 19 it says we know that we live in him and he in us<split> because he has given us of his spirit that's why when I yielded to the Holy Spirit he took over and we have seen and testify that the father has sent his son to be the savior of the world if anyone of knowledge is that Jesus is the Son of God God lives in him and he in God so if you acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of God then God lives in you and you in him that is if anyone is in Christ he is a new creature so if you have not of knowledge the Lord if you have not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior call me at two one zero six nine five one six three zero let's go back to first John chapter four starting with verse fifteen so if anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God God lives in him and he in God and so we know and rely on the love God has for us this is my confidence I don't have to think to take myself seriously because God loves me already and he is not going to abandon me or allow me to be put in shame because he loves me and you too and so we know and rely on the love God has for us god is love whoever lives in love lives in God and God in him verse 17 in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him let me read that again verse 17 in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love we love because He first loved us if you listen to the radio broadcast last week you heard on how I always ask God many questions but instead of God rebuking me he loved to answer my questions I developed my relationship with him first and foremost the Holy Spirit led me and taught me how to develop that relationship and because I had this relationship with the Lord Jesus I got to know his character his many facets he shared his plans and he showed me many things to come and when I study and read the Word of God the Holy Spirit was more than happy to reveal Jesus to me it is so simple but if Christ don't try to learn about God through religiosity and man-made doctrines once you know God and once you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you can share you can minister you can preach Jesus to others with such anointing with power and with tremendous results you my dear brothers and sisters you press on move forward and say goodbye to your past forget about those things that are behind us and you press on towards the mark of the high calling because greater joy and wonderful things are ahead the year 2016 is also a reset button for many of us who failed who had been hurt and even those who hurt others get right with God and allow God to deal with you so that he can share what's in his heart and what are his plans for you for 2016 and beyond and what are his plans for the bat of Christ he is a loving and a merciful God so it is important to understand many pastors here and even in the Philippines have asked me why are you so fearless and sometimes fears when you minister on the podium you are so confident you are so sure you're so bold because I know him personally many of you probably know the Scriptures more than I do you can quote scriptures left and right you know the word better than me but I know him I know how to get to the wonderful thing that I read about Smith Wigglesworth which is one of my favorites he said something that really touched me he said one time when God is not moving I move God what what a confidence what he was saying is when God is not moving because of people not listening not believing then by his faith in God and by his knowledge of who God is he moved God by his faith by his teaching and recorded 29 people that he raised from the dead you cannot argue with results you cannot argue with the fruits in his life but he always talked to God and he loved God's people that must be your confidence and a starting point to begin again to have a new beginning or to go to a higher level in the things of God it's 2016 and you know Christians should be the most exciting people the most influential people the most affluent show people on the face of the earth we're supposed to have life and we should light the room when we come in that we preserve wonderful things and we repel the darkness we should have all of this because God does not play favorites so I am having difficult time in telling myself and convincing myself that I am NOT God's fabric because the scripture says it in the book of James and the book of Romans that God does not show favoritism but in my walk with him I feel like I am his separate if I based everything on the facts I will be convinced that I am so special<split> than I am God's web right but I look at the truth and the truth poof in the Word of God says that God does not play febris so he loves you as much as he loves me and God the Father loves you as much as he loves his only begotten Son that's a lot of love we love because He first loved us so let us start with the exciting period and moment in the history of Christianity let us be recorded in the book of life that we are the generation who received at love and who loved him back and that will be the most influential and affluent shell generations of all times that would be great right let me pray for you Holy Father in the mighty name of Jesus I thank you for opening the hearts of my brothers and sisters to receive that love to receive that forgiveness to make them believe again that they have a new beginning and that they will be restored in 2016 Holy Father you gave us your best your only begotten Son so that we will have life and have it abundantly we thank you Holy Father for those that are being convicted by the Holy Spirit right now to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and to believe and to take the first step of faith by obeying your word and by believing that you are a loving and a merciful God I thank you for healing all their diseases and I thank your father that all the assignment against the bat of Christ are hereby canceled in the name of Jesus I thank you for God ordained a relationship I thank you for healing of family relationship Lord and thank you Lord for the manifestations of God ordained relationship in 2016 in Jesus name Amen join us in our Sunday
