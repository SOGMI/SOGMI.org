executive orders concerning the defunding of abortion and other righteous executive orders the weather calmed down especially here in Texas coincidence not God heard and answered our prayers and our land is being healed right now do not mind those who are causing troubles focus on the goodly and righteous things that are happening across this land our land is being healed glory to God continue to pray for our country and our leaders I also want to point out to you the accelerated manner in which our political or federal government is changing that is how fast the manifestation of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence in the body of Christ and for some almost in a blink of an eye those who believe and are ready your situation right now will be changed for the glory of God for your benefit and also for the benefit of others others will be inspired too<split> focus on our Lord Jesus Christ and to trust him only believe so let us continue to pray for our president and vice president and all of our political leaders righteous governance not only affect the economy or improve the economy of the country but also the body of Christ concerning the transfer of influence and affluence let me read to you this is what is going to happen when a righteous leader are in authority and they start passing law and implementing laws that are righteous that are right before God I say at chapter 32 verses 1 & 2 see a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice this is what is going to happen to us each man or each Christian will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land of course a king who will reign in righteousness is Jesus Christ so let this nation be under God it talks about our Lord Jesus Christ but it also includes rulers and kings in our present age so when the righteous are in authority the people of God rejoice so when a king will rule in righteousness and justice then the BOD of Christ will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm our instruction for 2017 which I shared at the prophetic gathering of the Saints on December 31st 2016 is Isaiah 43 verses 18 and 19 forget the former things do not dwell on the past see I am doing a new thing now it springs up do you not perceive it I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland one of the most challenged things that I have to do personally and I had to focus in 2017 is to really forget about the past and press on meaning that I have to change even my good habits in order for me not to go back to my established routine of the past I need to get me outside of the box I desire to yield and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit so every morning day by day I pray and then I try to finish things I need to do for that day be productive and I ask God I always ask the Holy Spirit to teach me I want to be teachable and you and I need to we need to prepare for new things which we never witness seen or heard before we entered a promised land or the promised land and would never been there before you know why sometimes you get into a rut we put ourselves in the box we even put God in a box because of what we know from experience and from studying and praying what worked in the past but God is making new things right now and we have to be teachable we have to be obedient so that we would not miss any opportunities out there okay this is going to be exciting for many of us Christians we will see a facet of God that we've never known before a lot of time we will experience and taste God that would never experience before in 2017 it is supernatural you know what a lot of times doctrines of men distort views and beliefs on the ways of God and who God is this time watch out and keep your spiritual lenses clear you will discover our Lord Jesus Christ as if for the first time so it's exciting some of our doctrines that we've been holding on for a long long time our ways of doing things will change and your life will be different you will be transformed into a different man let me go to John chapter 9 verse 1 John chapter 9 verse 1 it says as he went along he saw meaning Jesus he saw a man blind from birth his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind neither dis man or his parents sinned said Jesus but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life why do bad things happen to good people the answer is John chapter 9 verse 3 God allows things to happen so that the work of God might be displayed in our life the answer is through those bad things if we trust God if we focus on him the glory of God will be put on display so when something bad happened to people especially on Christians don't say that there's a sin in the camp or it's a judgment of God don't be quick because when it comes to dealing of the Lord when it comes to bad judgment God is really really slow in carrying out that judgment he didn't want to do it he is looking and hoping that you and I will intercede and pray instead of passing judgment okay why is it that sin isn't the camp or when bad things happen that is adjustment of God but when bad things happen to you you're being attacked by the devil remember the same measure when you judge it'll be the same measure that you will be judged so let us be careful with that because we are misrepresenting God he is merciful slow to anger it doesn't even keep record of wrongs he is a loving God and we need to meditate on that okay so let's go down to John chapter 9 down to verse 6 having said this meaning Jesus he spit on the ground<split> made some mud with the saliva and put it on the man's eyes go he told him wash in the pool of Siloam this word means sent so the man went and washed and came home seeing his neighbor's and those who had formerly seen him begging asked him isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg some claim that he was other said no he only looks like him but he himself insisted I am the man how then were your eyes opened they demanded he replied the man they called Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes he told me to go to Siloam and wash so I went and washed and then I could see where is this man they asked him I don't know he said they brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he put mud on my eyes the man replied and I washed and now I see verse 16 some of the Pharisee said this man is not from God for he does not keep the Sabbath but others asked how can a sinner do such miraculous signs so they were divided you know what look at this first sees they didn't even rejoice that this blind man blind from birth received his sight they were not even happy about it instead they were trying to fit and said well this not from God because it does not fit with our doctrine it doesn't fit in our sense of how God is going to move or act besides it's a Sabbath can you see it they say that oh that man it doesn't matter whether he opened your eyes he's not from God because he healed on the Sabbath so in verse 17 finally they turn again to the blind man what have you to say about him it was your eyes he opened the man replied he is a prophet the Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents is this your son they asked is this the one you say was born blind how is it that now he can see we know he's our son the parents answered and we know he was born blind but how he can see now or who opened his eyes we don't know ask him he is of age he will speak for himself his parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue they didn't bother to check for themselves that this is an awesome miracle but no he didn't belong to them we don't recognize him so therefore he's not a prophet he's not from God because we Pharisees did not recognize him John chapter 9 verse 22 his parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ will be put out of the synagogue they were so afraid they were more afraid to be put out of the synagogue than being happy that their son can now see that's what religiosity will do and that's what doctrines of men will do verse 20 for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind give glory to God they said we know this man is a sinner I love this reply verse 25 for those of you just tuning in I'm reading from John chapter 9 verse 25 he replied whether he is a sinner or not I don't know one thing I do know I was blind but now I see this is what I'm trying to get for you to focus on if you trust God and if you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you he will guide you into all truth who is Christ Jesus you will experience supernatural things that when people tell you oh no all prophets are gone God doesn't speak to us anymore in an audible voice and this day only through the Bible and no there are no miracles miracles are not for today you tasted you experienced supernatural things and miracles and even healing in your own life you can tell others those who are trying to talk you out of it that I don't know about your doctrines but one thing I do know I trusted Jesus and now I am healed I am delivered I am blessed so meditate on John chapter 9 verse 25 you believe it's going to happen to you in the name of Jesus verse 26 then they asked him what did he do to you how did he open your eyes he answered I have told you already and you did not listen why do you want to hear it again do you want to become his disciples to man that's one thing that they didn't want to hear you know religious people I'm not talking about righteous people I'm talking about so many religiosity Xand are holding on to their traditions and without their and without their permission nothing's going to be done because it has to be their way or the highway well it's too late now for 2017 supernatural manifestations are here to stay until the Lord comes whether you like it or not whether you agree with it or not so when this blind man now who was seeing asked them do you want to become his disciples to verse 28 then they<split> hurled insults at him and said you are this fellow's disciple we are disciples of Moses we know that God spoke to Moses yea they knew but but God is not speaking to them did you see that we know that God spoke to Moses but as for this fellow we don't even know where he comes from this man answered now that is remarkable you don't know where he comes from yet he opened my eyes we know that God does not listen to sinner's see because they were sin conscious to the Pharisees we know that God does not listen to sinners he listens to the godly man who does his will nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind if this man were not from God he could do nothing he challenged them nobody will ever perform this kind of miracles if they're not right with God if they don't have any right standing with God well the truth is we are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus it is important for us to understand that we are in a new season 2017 is here we have to allow God to reveal Jesus to us as if for the first time we need to continue to be teachable we need to continue to believe because you know what this is one thing I like I love about God nobody can disqualify you except you we should not depend on others anointing on others prayer for our miracles our faith can make us whole our faith in Christ Jesus you and I can do supernatural things all we need to do is to believe when Jesus said that his yoke is easy and his burden is life he is the truth so if what you're carrying now is heavy it is not from God and I don't care whether it was your fault it is high time now for the body of Christ to stop walking and condemnation looking back of the good old days holding on to offenses and the sins that they committed long time ago this is a fresh day this is a new day for all of us and I'm running out of time don't forget to go to our website SOG mi dot org we are living in exciting times and God is going to do wonderful things in your life today only believe just say thank you lord I claim it I may not understand it but just like what your word said in proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 I will trust you and I will not lean in my own understanding but in all my ways I will acknowledge you and you will direct my paths so it is it is tight time but if Christ okay continue to pray for our president continue to lay hands on yourself and pray be hopeful be exciting of today and our future
