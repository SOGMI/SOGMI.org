description: "In preparation for the upcoming Pentecost Celebration, Pastor Joshua Sosso revisits some of the prophetic words from the 2021 Prophetic Gathering of the Saints. It is essential that we focus on God and his promises in this season. He has promised to bring a move the likes of which has never happened in the history of the Church. So it doesn’t matter what the circumstances are. God will have His way. It doesn’t matter what schemes the wicked have put together. God will have his way. In II Chronicles 20:15 the people of God received the following prophetic Word, “Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s.” God is going to have His way and the government is going to be upon His shoulders! So let us focus on Him and obey what He has told us to do."
