description: "This season is a time of bountiful harvest, both good and bad. So if you need to make changes, make them now. If we as Christians vote according to what is aligned in God's heart, then this period will be recorded as a turning point towards righteousness and it will precipitate a great move all over the world. We need to be able to embrace changes and be willing to learn and unlearn things. Now is the time to act!"
