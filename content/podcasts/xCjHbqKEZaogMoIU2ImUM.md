description: "Prophetic instructions for this week: focus on God’s faithfulness and God’s goodness.\n\nJohn 10:10 “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” In Colossians chapter 3:3 it says, “For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.” So everything that we do, we have to do it unto Him. We must truly live, believe, that in Him we live and move and have our being, right? Romans 6:4 “We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”  ...New life, not [the] old one. God is not going to repair the old life that you have. He made it new.\n\nRomans 6:4, 8:2, 8:9-11\n\n2 Corinthians 3:6"
