hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom force of charts and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time I am in Vancouver Canada glory to God you know it was a little bit challenging to pack winter clothes while it was still 90 degrees in San Antonio two weeks before my departure I was out in the garden cleaning bagging some leaves pulling some weeds while talking to God and I told God I am fed up with a heat in Texas and I'm going to call forth the cold front in the name of Jesus I was determined to do just that when I heard that small still quiet voice telling me Cristina aren't you going to Canada oh that's right if I call forth the cold front I will freeze while there so I called forth rain instead see God is in the details even the things that we take for granted the things that we don't even know that we need in to prepare us he is in the details he is an awesome wonderful God and it has been a great summer we received many opportunities the body of Christ this country is turning around you focus on the godly changes in our country okay great opportunities many of those in the bat of Christ are now a part and actively in the manifestation of the prophecy regarding transfer of wealth influence and affluence so it's amazing it's breathtaking and I'm going to share some of those manifested in the beginning of the first two or three weeks in the fall which is a few days or a few weeks from now for me I have to prepare and I'm gonna share with you what God did to encourage you to inspire you and to admonish you continue to move forward continue to expect that your future and your present are a lot greater than your past no matter how good they are so you have this opportunity this year in this new season to be a part of the great harvest that is coming upon this earth for the body of Christ so it has been a great summer one of the manifestations of prophecies is my trip to Vancouver Canada the Lord prophesied and spoke to me while there about three or four years ago that as soon as my daughter graduates from high school that he's going to send me back all over North America so it is a great news it's a great news for our country so I get to cause trouble someplace else other than the state of Texas I got the skinned people alive through the Word of God and in love and then I got to come back to Texas it's amazing see God can use you that way don't seek the limelight and there comes a time that you will wish that nobody will recognize you that you will remain private so enjoy the moment okay don't rush into one thing to be in the front lines enjoy every moment enjoy the process because God loves to be included in the process of our maturing in him of our faith walk so if you're asking me how come many of your personal prophecies are not coming to pass is that God's fault and definitely it's not my fault okay I'm a messenger but that's it I'm not responsible for manifesting those prophecies because they're so awesome it is your decision to follow the instructions personal prophecies are conditional but thank God that love of God is in traditional each prophecy contains instruction or condition and they're simple be consistent focus on God only believe do not fear don't compromise and of course the just shall live by faith the instruction contains in your personal prophecies are easily entreated they're not difficult sometimes we jump into conclusion when God is giving us instruction when we jump into conclusion we compromise we give in to fear or doubt or suspicion God is always wonderful God is perfect and God loves you I always admonish people not to focus on the manifestation or fulfillment of their personal prophecy but instead meditate and focus on obeying the instruction or condition contained in those prophecies if you don't things get postponed or it might take too long or it will become too hard if you don't follow God's ways of doing things and or the worries of life or even riches will distract you from meditating and focusing on the Word of God his plan for you and his instructions so I want you to remember that personal prophecies and prophecies for the church are important because why they are very specific they Lord for your present situation and your needs and God's perfect plan for your life keep that in mind they are important nowadays they are important especially in these last days if you believe that God is faith that God is all-powerful all-knowing Almighty and all loving then you and I should not have any problem in believing him and God does not have any problem in making things come to pass we should receive prophecies with great joy and you should test of course the prophecy by the word of God and not just by the word of God not just that it lines with a<split> scripture but who God is the character six of our God he is faithful he is kind he is tender-hearted when you believe your prophecy and follow instruction and you are being patient when the prophecy manifest even your loved ones will benefit you'll change the course of history especially in your lineage the body of Christ will benefit and the entire nation or the world will benefit just because you believe God and just because you take your post in the kingdom don't ever disqualify yourself as long as it is today and you obey God and you worship Him you have a bright future keep that in mind now how do we receive personal prophecies how do you receive the prophecy if you believe that the DA say Lord that is coming from God himself using the mouth of his people or especially his prophets you must receive the prophecy with great joy and humility like King David King David whose heart is after God's own heart received his prophecies with humility and Thanksgiving here's one example in 2nd samuel chapter 7 verses 17 to 22 it says Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation then King David went in and sat before the Lord and he said Who my or Sovereign Lord and what is my family that you have brought me this far and if this were not enough in your sight of Sovereign Lord you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant is this your useful way of dealing with men or sovereign Lord in other words King David told God all these things that you have blessed me with and now you're even discuss the future of my lineage is this the normal thing for you God all these things that you blessed me with and now you're telling me about the future is this normal to you is this how you bless a lot of times I look back I'm always very grateful for the Lord loving me and never gave up on me it's an overwhelming kind of love but aren't you glad that he is a loving God so now down to verse 25 were still in second Samuel chapter 7 verse 25 it says and now Lord God keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant in his house do as she promised in first Kings chapter 2 verse 4 and that the Lord may keep his promise to me if your descendants watch how they live and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel see the prophecy - King David affected his house his lineage and the condition is the same if you walk faithfully before me with all your heart and soul then the lineage will continue to have a man on the throne the lineage of King David so King David's descendants were blessed because of him and the entire awesome fulfillment of the promise of God - David came with one package complete package throughout eternity Christ Jesus who is now the king of kings and Lord of lords and we are his body our receiving from God our obedience to his instruction to his word even our faith will bless the future generation especially our loved ones so if you're wondering because I've been sharing with you many personal prophecies and prophesy to the church are now being fulfilled how come your prophecies are not manifesting after you examined everything you believe God you're not sinning you followed everything in your power to do after in following the instruction to the letter and still it's not manifesting then you need to examine your love walk it's a heart issue we're not just talking about if you love yourself if you're being selfish or if you're not loving people enough yes all of those are necessary but it's also your love walk with God your relationship with God okay it's a heart issue now let's go back and always keep in mind that every time you make a decision this will be easy for you if you don't know what to do if you have choices out there and in your heart and in your mind you want to follow your heart's desire but still there's still a check in your spirit or in your heart there's one thing that you can do that you can never go wrong always consider the heart of other God okay we all know about the parable of the prodigal son in Luke chapter 15 starting with verse 11 through 31 right it's about two sons and a loving father the younger son asked for his inheritance and after he received it from his father he went away and squandered everything and when he was starving he went back to his father his plan was to beg for his father's forgiveness or asked for an opportunity to be hired as one of the servants instead the father welcomed him with such great joy prepared a feast for him and then there's a heart issue about the older brother the other son let us go ahead and fast-forward it to Luke chapter 15 verse 28 I'm reading from New Living Translation it says the older brother was angry and would not go in his father came<split> out and begged him but he replied all these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to and in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends yet when this son of yours come back after squandering your money on prostitutes you celebrate by killing the fattened calf his father said to him look there son you have always stayed by me and everything I have is yours we had to celebrate this happy day for your brother was dead and has come back to life he was lost but now he is found the older brother did not care about anything else except what he deserved and he wanted his younger brother to be punished he didn't care about anything else except himself what he did how he obeyed the rules how he stayed there how he worked hard he did not care about his father missing his younger brother and that his father was brokenhearted when one of his sons left and he didn't care also about losing his brother now that is a hard issue we need to examine ourselves in this time of restoration and healing rejoice over the brothers and sisters when their dreams come true don't ever rejoice in the punishment of the wicked and don't expect God to judge them harshly he is a loving and a merciful God so don't even rejoice when he punishes someone especially those people who have hurt you instead look at things with God's perspective follow his own heart consider how our loving God and father would want us to react and what he would want us to do or say rather be wronged and rather be gullible don't wish any one wrong even if you are definitely sure that they deserve it God does not rejoice in the punishment of the wicked he said that very clearly in Ezekiel chapter 33 verse 11 it says say to them as surely as I live the clerks of Sovereign Lord I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live God is not pleased with us when we rejoice over the death over the downfall or destruction of anyone even than our enemies he is a loving God his desire is he wants everybody to get saved so don't be jealous do not envy be patient and kind towards others when choices will come before you pause and consider the heart of a loving father and a merciful Lord keep in mind in the parable of the prodigal son the father already divided their inheritance equally so when the younger son came back their father did not take away from the oldest son's inheritance it has nothing to do with him so the older son had a heart issue and he is likened to some Christians who are a sinful of others victories of others happiness of others promotions of others blessings they're also sometimes her sinful of the fact that God is generous and merciful and they sometimes resent the fact that Christians are getting blessed so some Christians are getting blessed and are generous to others that is covetousness - and that is wrong perception of who God is it is a wrong perception of a loving and a generous God that he knows he knows all the issues of our hearts in proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 says above all else guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life above anything else guard your heart proverbs 24 12 if you say but we knew nothing about this does not he who weighs the heart perceive it does not he who guards your life know it will he not repay its person according to what he has done in in Philippians chapter 4 verse 7 it says and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus who and what will guard your heart the peace of God it is the peace of God because he's the Prince of Peace so be patient my dear brothers and sisters prophecies are manifesting and check your heart issue yours will manifest - God will even intervene on the things that you have lost even the mistakes he doesn't look and focus on your mistakes he's not looking for the mistakes that you are created and pounce on it to judge you he is not like that you and I need to ask the Holy Spirit to examine our hearts and follow the prescription of the Great Physician he loves you and I and remember he is a loving and a just God so thank God and rejoice with me for a great and awesome trip to Canada especially British Columbia it is a nice place let me pray for you Holy Father in the name of Jesus I thank you that by and through your Holy Spirit that you open our hearts and make us vulnerable to your love I thank you Father that the sound of my voice that my brothers and sisters will take their post and they will receive and that their personal prophecies their heart's desire will manifest and will begin to manifest starting this year as we approach this harvest season the change of season we thank you Holy Father that we continue to<split> increase in numbers I thank you father for the healing of relationships I thank you Lord for the manifestation of God ordained relationship I thank you for financial breakthrough for my brothers and sisters in Christ and as they believe and obey you I thank you that your children will begin to live heaven on earth it's starting this year starting the season in Jesus name Amen and amen so rejoice with me and get excited for the things that lie ahead and I have such a busy schedule and I'm enjoying every moment of it just to give you a heads up I will be leaving a tour to Israel on the first part of June 2017 to coincide
