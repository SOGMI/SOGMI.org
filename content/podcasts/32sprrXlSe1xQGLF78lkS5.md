description: "When the Israelites went to the promise land, they found giants there that looked impossible to beat. Ten of the spies only looked with fear, but two remembered the promise of God. Similarly, we must also focus on the promises of God, and not look at the giants in our own promise land with fear. Remove the limitations you are putting on God. Prepare for the Harvest."
