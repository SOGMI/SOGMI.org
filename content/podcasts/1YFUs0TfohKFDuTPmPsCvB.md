description: "We in the Body of Christ have put too much of our trust in man. It is true that God used President Trump to introduce righteous changes in the earth. However, many in the Church began to rely on him and put all the focus on him instead of relying on God. We have forgetten about our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ must be our first and foremost! Whenever we put our trust in man or man's systems we are stepping outside of God's commandments. We need to turn back to God! It's not too late. God has spoken that He will bring a political revival in this nation the likes of which the United States has never seen. He still intends to manifest this in this nation and He's going to get all the glory and all the praise for it. Focus on God! Trust in Him!"
