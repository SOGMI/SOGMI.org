description: "In this episode Pastor Cristina goes over instructions and prophecies for the year 2024. During this year, we must make sure not to squander any opportunities God has given us. We must spend time with Him, and listen to Him, so that we can be made holy. Those that have separated themselves will see signs and wonders manifest. As we focus on Him, we will go deeper in His things ways and soar higher."
