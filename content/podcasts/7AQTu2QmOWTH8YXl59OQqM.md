description: "The intensity of things will continue to increase, but if the Body of Christ unites and votes for righteousness, it will be for the better. We must focus on the issues important and dear to God's heart and vote accordingly. The nameless and faceless are being raised up. It is not too late for us to be among them, but we must not waste any more time or make any more excuses. Yes we will face challenges, but we will overcome them with a pure heart and the mindset that victory has already been handed to us by Christ on the Cross."
