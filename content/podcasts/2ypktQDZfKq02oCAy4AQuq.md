hello this is Cristina Sosso of freedom fellowship church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time you know I did not know what to talk about in this program this week so late in the afternoon this week I took time to prepare myself but I was not getting anything see it is a lot easier for me to prepare a message for Sunday and Wednesday services you know why because if I miss something or if I need to change something the Holy Spirit leads me to change the message modify it which he often does and then he moves so it is good to be led by the Holy Spirit but not on the radio because I have to record this ahead of time and I am happy to tell you that I'm still a student when it comes to the ministry I am NOT a natural minister or preacher but I'm students of the Holy Spirit so I didn't know what to do so I went out for a drive to talk to God then after about 30 45 minutes talking and and listening I heard God say Cristina tell them I love them is that awesome or what God really really loves you okay stay tuned we're talking about the love of God in John chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 you know that you have memorized it for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life for God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him you know my dear brothers and sisters God is not focused on your sins or mistakes or any of your shortcomings he is loved and he is our righteousness so when you make a mistake god is not ready to pounce so that he can punish you to teach you a lesson keep in mind all good things come from God so all bad things come from the devil God is all good and the devil is all bad when you make mistakes run towards God he is more than willing to forgive you he is more than willing to restore you believe in that because it is the truth see when we were born again or when you were born again let's talk about you every time God looks at you he is looking at Jesus his son we are his body that is why God the Father loves you as much as he loves His only begotten Son keep in mind when Abba Father looks at you he's not looking at your flaws he's not looking at your mistakes or your shortcomings he is looking at your life and future with and in Christ Jesus I first got a taste of the love of God in 1989 I was a new Christian I just got born again ever since I was a child I have accepted the Lord Jesus as my savior but he became a lord of my life in 1988 but in 1989 I mean I made a big time boo-boo I thought I was doing things for God you know I was told by the people you have to do this you have to give this away you have to accommodate this I thought all of those things I was doing for God and I realized that those things are not from him so I cried I cried I was so brokenhearted and I was telling God that I was telling God I don't like being with Christians I don't like the way I feel every time I'm with some people because for me they're not being Christian like I prefer my friends that were not born again because they were treating me right in comparison to some of the Christians in our group so I cried and did not sleep that night talking to God asking for forgiveness I thought I really messed things up big time but around 3 o'clock then I finally fell asleep God woke me up at 5:30 he told me to look out the window and the Sun is about to rise he told me Cristina it's a new day you have a new beginning my love for you is fresh every morning and nothing nothing that you did or that you've done will separate us that can separate my love for you you can start all over again he said that in such gentleness and great love he never mentioned about my faults my mistakes so when bad things happen to Christians don't ever say that God is teaching you something don't ever say that yes God is teaching us some things the Holy Spirit is teaching us about the love of God that he will never leave us nor forsake us he is our teacher so he's teaching us something not through pain and afflictions those were not his choices but through love through compassion through healing through restoration and deliverance he is teaching us by revealing himself to us through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit when you sin and if you already repented and asked God for forgiveness and if you already did everything that God is wanting or telling you to do to correct things to make things right when you receive that forgiveness stop walking in guilt or under condemnation why no one can accuse you of that sin or can even remind you of that ever because God erased all of those sins and shortcomings from his memory bank when he looks at you he sees Jesus<split> glory to God Jesus paid for our sins walk in the liberty of that love of his love for you the Holy Spirit will continue to teach you and guide you don't ever say that you're a student of the Bible if you study the Bible without the revelation from the Holy Spirit it will be like any other book and there will be false doctrines false teachings and religiosity that will come out from it say rather that you are a student of the Holy Spirit now that is scriptural it's biblical because that's what Jesus said the Holy Spirit will be your teacher and he will guide you into all truth so God is love and he loves you keep that in mind when he sees you and I he sees Jesus in first John chapter 3 verse 1 it says how great is the love the father has lavished on us lavished it missus a very extremely generous it's pressed down shaken together and running over how great is the love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God and that is what we are the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him also in efficient chapter 1 verse 5 says he meaning God predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ in accordance with his pleasure and will keep in mind that you and I will get to know father God we will only get to know father God if we know our Lord Jesus Christ if we have intimate relationship with him you want to know God the Father get to know our Lord Jesus Christ and obey His commandments in John chapter 14 starting with verse 7 all the way to 17 I want you to look it up and meditate on it he was addressing his disciples in John chapter 14 starting with verse 7 it says if you really knew me you would know my father as well then Jesus prophesied to them he says from now on you do know him and have seen him Philip said Lord show us the father and that will be enough for us jesus answered don't you know me Philip even after I have been among you such a long time anyone who has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father don't you believe that I am in the father and that the father is in me the words I say to you are not just my own rather it is the father living me who is doing his work believe me when I say that I am in the father and the father is in me or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves I tell you the truth anyone was faith in me will do what I have been doing he will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father and I will do whatever you ask in my name how much whatever so that the son may bring glory to the father I want you to keep that in mind whatever Jesus does or say he is intent and his purpose is to bring glory to the Father so when he answers or manifests our prayers or our heart's desire he brings glory to the Father you may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it everything that Jesus did even dying on the cross his focus and his intent is to glorify the Father his heart his mind is always God the Father when God the Father gave His only begotten Son Jesus we are on his mind we are in his heart and his plan because why because through the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ mankind was reconciled back to the Father so whomsoever who believed in the son will have an everlasting life then the Holy Spirit teaches us Jesus Christ and God the Father they were on his mind awesome huh so the Holy Spirit is not going to speak on his own just like what Jesus said he will only speak what he hears from God the Father and God the Son that is awesome how can we go wrong we have the holy spirit here is our teacher he's our advocate he is our friend and he will guide us into all truth don't ever say that you are having a hard time in seeing and receiving the love of God the Father because you never knew your dad or he did not treat you right your past was erased when you were born again those are gone and you have a new DNA in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit will teach you about the love of God because he is love don't try to use that as an excuse to be stubborn or not to believe God or to receive what he has for you you know our natural mother carried us in our wombs for nine months when you were born again in a blink of an eye you were born of the Spirit all things are past you have become a new creature everything is made new I want you to meditate on what I am Telling You today because it is important God was in love with you and is called you by name he loved you while you were sinners so much more now I never heard in my own experience in my own life my own walk with God I never heard the father pointing and reminding me of my past or the sins that I committed even when I grieved him and when I cry and run to him and ask for forgiveness he always talked to me in love as if nothing happened he<split> pointed up something that I have done right for him and how he was delighted you know King David was under the Old Covenant but he really knew God and the heart of God and we have the Holy Spirit now what did I say that when he committed the sin when he got himself into trouble in Psalm 68 verse 5 it says this is King David and said for your name's sake or Lord preserve my life in your righteousness bring me out of trouble the nerve right he committed sin against God and yet David had the audacity to tell God God for your name's sake not for my name but for your name's sake why because it was God who anointed David to be king he was the one who chose him to be king so here he is King David a sinner says for your name's sake o Lord preserve my life in your righteousness bring me out of trouble so it's just like saying I made a mistake I'm in trouble and I caused this trouble Lord but because I belong to you then don't kill me this is preserve my life and because you are so righteous and I belong to you get me out of this mess the mess I created myself but it doesn't matter because you called me and you are in love with me isn't that amazing so if you're still walking with guilt and condemnation and you think that you have to pay penance you have to penalize yourself or get afflicted or deny yourself with a lot of things because you don't deserve it then if you can earn your forgiveness then try to earn your salvation also at the same time because they all come from God so as we didn't do anything as far as our salvation remember the Holy Spirit convicted us that that we were sinners and that we needed a savior then we came and asked the Lord to be our Savior and our Lord in our life and we were born-again we didn't earn anything same thing when we ask God for forgiveness we don't need to pay penance because jesus paid it all okay so David knew a loving God why he has this relationship with God and those times because he's beginning to see who God is in Psalm 68 verse 5 it says that God is a father to the fatherless and a defender of widows is God in His holy dwelling there is a new season of discovery how wonderful and how great is the love of the father towards you make it personal get to know him and when you wake up in the morning thank him for the new beginning of the day isn't that awesome we just celebrated Father's Day last week and now the Holy Spirit instructed me to tell each and every one of you that he loves you so rejoicing let me pray for you Holy Father I did what you asked me to do I told them that you love them that you love me and then as much as you love your only begotten Son Holy Father you did not even rejoice or you cannot rejoice or can delight in the punishment of the wicked it is so much more that you desire to bring healing and salvation and deliverance to your people Thank You Holy Father for their deliverance I pray that you open their hearts and give them understanding how much you want to bless them how much you desire to walk with them how much you wanted to save them to deliver them it is your heart's desire that we all live heaven on earth thank you for Jesus Christ our Lord Lord Jesus I thank you for everything that you've done for us we are in awe on how deep is your love for us we do not understand it but we are grateful that you are we give you all the praise we give you all the glory in Jesus name I thank you for those of you that have not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior come to him he loves you and your past will be erased and you have a new beginning coving a21 zero six nine five one six three zero give me the opportunity to lead you to him and I guarantee you your life will never be the same again I will never trade my life with God for anything or anyone on the face of the earth and I'm still discovering his attributes his plan unfolding before my very eyes it is such a great and wonderful awesome season for all of us it is a season of manifested blessings it is a season of personal prophecies being fulfilled it is a season of the revelation of Christ that God loves us so are you I can tell you a lot of wonderful stories about the great and awesomeness of our God and I am touch every time I even remember the things when I make mistakes and I'm always brokenhearted and he must be disappointed that I failed him and all he always say is no he's delighted because I have come to that knowledge and I accepted the mistakes and now he was telling me that I am I have become more teachable in his ways and have compassion for others you see the flick shion's in our lifetime even the challenges God's love is greater God's power is awesome and we have the authority in the name of Jesus in heaven and on earth and he told us that whatever we lose here on earth is loosed<split> in heaven and whatever we bind here on earth is bound in heaven we have to believe that when we lose something they are loosed and when we bind they will be bound it is like a king giving a decree and that decree cannot be reversed not unless the king himself reverses it so it is important that we understand our Authority and I will address more of the father and son relationship so that you can appreciate our Lord Jesus Christ and you will be delighted and excited about what lies ahead forget about the past there is nothing you can do about it but today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts you of a new beginning and we have a brighter future ahead and I'm running out of time
