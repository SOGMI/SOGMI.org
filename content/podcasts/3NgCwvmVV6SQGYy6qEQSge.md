hello this is Christina Sosso of freedom Fellowship Church and sons of God International and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time thank you for those who showed up in our fundraising events last week we are so worn out you know you have to prepare for the preparation and then the actual two days it was a little bit challenging for me I told the team at least we survived we know and we demonstrated to the Lord that we are more than willing to do it because we know if you are willing and obedient you eat the best of the land so that fundraising event is one of those challenges that we really need to walk and overcome fatigue business etc yes we are raising funds for a good cause and at the same time it is also a training ground for the youth and for everybody else especially the youth that whatever you do you have to put your best and move forward it may be hard work but it can be enjoyable and our young people our younger generation must realize that it involves hard work it involves your effort and if they do that and if they are willing and obedient and apply God's ways of doing things what we have attained us their parents they will attain it in a short period of time because of the revelation and because of the greatness of the season that we are in so easy money but it's God's Way and it's more than that so thank you for those who participated thank you we're going to hold another one next month I'm not sure what date yet right now I am focused on the prophetic conference next week have you registered yet do not wait to the last minute there might not be a space for you seating is limited go to our website at www.irs.gov and click events you will be issued a ticket and you need to bring that with you for those of you who registered get excited god is awesome and there will never be a dull moment with Jesus you will fall in love with him all over again he is that good and you know it and since this is the last week until Friday for the big event if you already registered I have your name and if you're about ready to register I will have your name this is all I need and as soon as isolate myself I will ask God about you only good stuff ok only good stuff so don't don't be concerned about anything else don't be concerned remember John chapter 1 starting with verse 45 it says philip found nathanael and said to him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and a Fanueil said to him can any good come out of Nazareth Phillips said to him come and see Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no deceit Nathanael said to him how do you know me jesus answered and said to him before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree I saw you Nathanael answered and said to him rabbi you are the son of God you are the king of Israel that is our really fast attitude adjustment right and if you notice Jesus didn't say I am really the Messiah and I don't like the way you're telling noble things will come out of Nazareth I'm offended by it listen to those of you that have a prophetic gifting or are calling the office of a prophet you should not be offended that easy okay and you pray for people on the negative things that are happening in their lives and talk to them and so don't be afraid that I might expose you because God doesn't operate that way okay it will be God's only choice as far as you're concerned when he call you out and believe me when I'm prophesying you will know that you're getting rebuked or corrected I might not I might realize it because I'm focused on your destiny just like Jesus was focused on the fan yells destiny and who he really is once he believed in Jesus Christ that he will get transformed that's what God is one thing to focus on God is not interested about your past and I'm not I'm interested about today and your future because it's a greater thing in the things of God this is what prophecy is all about okay so get excited get excited these are the great times that we need to be excited hopeful and energized all the time right because for one thing because for one thing on what God is doing you need to be so so excited the greatness of the season that we are in that is the theme of this prophetic conference it is not oh the bad things that are happening all around us the bad things that is happening<split> in the world no it's the greatness of the season we are in this is the theme of this prophetic conference and here's why we are witnessing a political revival for a lot of people out there it's more like political upheavals in this country but at the same time the man the station of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence in the body of Christ is happening it is happening to those who have been faithful and are obedient and are continually applying God's ways of doing things here on earth this is why you have been experiencing changes in your lives whether they're good ones whether they're bad ones there are always result in greater things to come okay I want you to hold on to that changes in your business hopefully changes in your ministry so changes changes changes promotion and transformation if you are experiencing something that you don't understand right now or sensing something is about ready to pop even negative things cut it all joy it means that God is including you in this great move embrace the change keep your hopes up be faithful and enjoy the process that is a challenge for all of us if you tell me that well it is easier said than done we as Christians what choice do we have we have to evolve because the church is going to emerge as a glorious church either we go against the grain either we go against the tidal wave that is sweeping the world and get swept away or just go with the flow it is the Lord who is doing great things here on earth for us Christians that will be and that should be the only choice that we have in this matter do you really want to make your own decision and chart your own course instead of God's in this matter in this present age I don't think so when God makes changes on the earth they are drastic they are supernatural and that's where we're heading yes of course our challenges on the flesh because the flesh and the spirit that is in us are always at war so forget about the flesh the flesh is going to line up sooner I don't want it to say later soon so there are new and great things you will not understand that you can analyze them because you never experienced them before you never received them before and these are new understanding so we need the Holy Spirit the let us focus on what God is doing in you and through you let the world focus on the bad things that are happening in the world but let us focus on the good things because those good things are from God and what he is about to do on the face of the earth he is going to reveal it to us first okay God will not do anything on the face of the earth without revealing them first to his servants the prophets that's in Amos right okay so now the prophetic mental of sons of God International and the Apostolic Bantle we are going to share them with you on what God is saying to the church and to the nations in our present age so get excited okay don't be nervous about it and I got your name and if you're nervous that you might be exposed that is not God's business that is not my business and read the John chapter 1 verse 40 all the way so that you understand it on how God saw enough annual in spite of everything else because he was snooty he was prejudiced no good things will come out of Nazareth and here comes Jesus so he had a real fast attitude adjustment okay Holy Spirit is involved so don't worry about it but get excited why the kingdom of God is not a manner of eating nor drinking but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit has to be involved right now so let him have his way not your way okay so if the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking let me ask you this the we Christians backslide because we always try to figure out where to go and eat after the service on Sundays our excuse that freedom faucet Church is we already ate spirit of food so now we have to feed the body also the temple of the Holy Spirit what should we eat but no as long as we focus on God right so let us focus on what God is saying to the church right now you will be so excited and if you are one of those negative people the doom and gloom kind of guy don't worry about it you show up because I have a deliverance ministry if that didn't work and you continue to spout on the negative things I will lay hands on you in a special powerful way okay it's a different kinds of playing of hands because why get excited Exodus 18 verse 9 it says Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord has done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians numbers 1032 I like this because I have an expanded Christina's version on this okay numbers 1032 it says if you come with us we will share with you whatever good things the Lord gives us my expanded version numbers 1032 if you attend this prophetic<split> conference we will share all the good things the Lord is giving us we were going to share you we're going to share the instruction and we will contaminate you with our excitement and our hope because our focus is on Christ Jesus so believe receive obey follow instruction from the Lord to the letter and afterwards you'll be overjoyed and you will say or quote the scripture to the Lord in 2nd Samuel 728 you will quote this to the Lord it says o Sovereign Lord you are God your words are trustworthy and you have promised these good things to your servant see he's going to promise you good stuff because he already saw you on the plan of God and who you are in Christ Jesus and you're gonna sing Psalm 103 verses 2 through 5 it says praise the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the Eagles so we're all concerned and we're spending a lot of money on anti aging including myself right but Psalm 103 verse 5 says who satisfies your desires with good things and when that happened what is the purpose of God why does God want to bless you so that your youth is renewed like the Eagles he created and he invented and he started the anti-aging so this is the formula for you Psalm 103 verse 5 that's why you need to attend this conference but you have to hurry and register because seeding is really limited okay I'm serious about that need to focus on good things talk about them praise God for them and stay hopeful excited and remain faithful he speak his heart and his will his words only proverbs 13 verse 2 from the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things but the unfaithful have a craving for violence we're seeing that now but from our mouth we can enjoy good things if we speak his heart and his will okay in Luke chapter 6 verse 45 it says the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks this is also in Matthew 12 35 in 2nd Corinthians chapter 9 verse 8 it says God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work it is the purpose and the plan and the heart of God that we will be blessed that he will be able that you will let him bless you in everything all the works of your hand so that you can share him to others this is what second corinthians 9:8 is all about and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work that is his purpose we always benefit on all the instructions we also benefit and matured in the discipline of the Lord right because his motivation is always love so this upcoming conference is one of the ways if not the best way to let you know of the good news that we're getting from God sometimes we do not understand what is going on in our lives or even what we sense in the spirit this is why we need the fellowship of the Saints we need to come together it does not work when you want to hear from God at your convenience Jesus says that the kingdom of God is forcefully advancing and the violent take it by force that is in Luke chapter 16 verse 16 so you have to really make the effort okay God doesn't want me catering to people so if he doesn't want me to do it not unless he tells me I'm not doing it okay no matter how special you are in Luke chapter 16 verse 16 it says the law and the prophets were proclaimed until John since that time the good news of the kingdom is always good news concerning the kingdom of God the good news of the kingdom is being preached and everyone is forcing his way into it so always remember it's always good news when it comes to the kingdom of God and how it is preached the kingdom of God has come to us once we got born again and the kingdom of God is within us which is the holy spirit teaching and leading us we cannot get into the kingdom of God other than the Holy Spirit way because the Holy Spirit will continue to reveal Jesus to us and he will tell us of things to come he will also teach us his ways of doing things in the kingdom of our God it is not how smart we are if we are faithful okay so I do not accept any private or personal ministry not unless you really cannot make it and even that's the case not unless God tells me I don't want to do it okay because it is not that way because all the time some people will call and said I'm sorry I missed the conference but can we have dinner and I'll buy you dinner and said like no I can cook my own dinner or I<split> can pay for my own dinner because they want me to spend time listening to God and to them prophesied to them and share them everything because they were so busy to attend the conference what about those who got in line who registered who prayed for this conference who spend time money and effort to come to the conference they are more special and they will be so blessed because they took the time to hear what God is saying it means to say that they're interested in their putting God first the things that we can do God will not do it for us no matter how anointed we think we are I get those everywhere even I go overseas but you know what even after cancer victims were healed the blind see people got born again no matter how annoyed I am when I get home I can prophesy with all my heart with my soul with more my strength to those dirty dishes in the sink they refuse to obey me even though I am so anointed because I just got out from a very anointed conference because why because I can do them I can do them I can wash dishes or I always have a telling ministry I will asked or tell my children to do it if they're not too tired are you getting this so there are especial instances that God sends me to the rich and the powerful people or even to the poorest among his people don't mind as long as it is the Lord who is sending me because he never play fabrics I never forget when God sent me in the veena to one of the most dangerous place in the world especially in those times it is a few weeks before the election and there were two Muslim political arrival powerful families who tried to destroy it other and in that election one of the clans murdered about 80 people women children and some journalists who happen to be travelling with them in somewhere buried alive they even used government equipment to bulldoze the bodies some they're still in the cars and buried them that particular city shut down because they expect that the other family were going to fight back so the city shut down for almost two weeks and no buying and selling even the banks were closed the pastors and Christians in the area were crying out for help for somebody to pray for them or even to train them on how to operate in the gift so that they can defend themselves and they can engage effectively in spiritual warfare and no one dared to go from the Philippines no one there to go for one thing not all it's dangerous most of the people there are poor they will not give any offering except fruits and their love and their affection for you so God sent me and Davina from Texas what a privilege right for Texas so he sent us there and gave a specific instruction and some of the pastors that are a member of this team in the Philippines were brave enough to go with us they were willing to risk their lives a few hours after Davina and I landed in Manila and the shopping center in that city was bombed by terrorists so I looked at the Venus at de vino' Satan thought that you're going shopping there and we laughed about it we had to go through when we were there we had to go through at least three checkpoints to go to the town where we held the pastors conference it was hot and muggy and they had power outages every thirty minutes the structure was made of cinder blocks and metal roof with no ceiling in between and no windows by the podium it was so hot but the pastor's there and the young people they were so hungry and I was told that revival broke out amongst the youth after were gone on the second day of the conference it rained so hard in our shoes or sandals were full of mud and we did not want to step on the vehicles they provided because they were so clean I found a small puddle of water and washed my feet and shoes but Davina was not able to one of the pastor's scooped water using his hand and started cleaning the Venis feet and sandals with his bare hands it was so humbling and overwhelming what love when I told the pastor's that God sends me and Davina to them to specifically answer the prayer and to equip them some of the pastors broke down in tears why they were surrounded by their enemies some of their houses got burned some of the members of their congregations got killed they are being persecuted in a predominantly Muslim people with those extreme I said like a lot of the Muslims in the Philippines they're not extreme but they were some but they're getting attacked on all fronts but God heard your prayer and God loved on them and he gave them exact prophetic words encouragement and instruction and revealed their future and they cannot help themselves some of them broke in tears but they believed and so there's a revival and still going on this is what this prophetic conference is all about to share with you the good news of the gospel and the dusty of the<split> Lord for our country for our great state and for you individually God has the answer to whatever situation that you're in and because he is the sir so whatever you're dealing with but you have to take it you have to do everything in your power to do your part what can you do you do what can you give you give what you can offer offer to him and fulfill them this is how easy it is
