description: "Listen to God's commands and the Lord will work out the rest. If He has called you to a position, He will establish you. You do not need to force your way in. However, He will not establish you until you are ready. Therefore, let us rely on the Holy Spirit and make sure we are ready. The actions of leaders impact many, so we must make sure that we are already disciplined and reliant on God before we are established. "
