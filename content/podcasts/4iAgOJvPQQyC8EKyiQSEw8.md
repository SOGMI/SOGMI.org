description: "By the end of this broadcast, youâ€™ll be thinking about faith in a different way. As we know, without faith it is impossible to please God, and we hear about that in Hebrews 11. Because at the very core of our beliefs we have to believe that God exists and that what He says is true, and we have to act according to it. We have inherited the calling of Abraham, and it is through us, the Body of Christ, that all nations of the earth will be blessed. However, before the greater things manifest, we must confront the issues in our personal lives and overcome them like the saints before us did."
