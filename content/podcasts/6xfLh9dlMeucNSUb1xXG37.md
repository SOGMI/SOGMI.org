description: "Those that are prepared for this great move of God— that have clean hands and pure hearts— You are good to go! Good to move forward into whatever God has been telling you all these years. Inquire of the Lord in everything you do, and do it all for His glory. Love God with all of your heart, soul, and mind, and everything else will line up— You're relationships, business, family, and ministry. You're good to go!"
