description: "In this episode, Pastor Cristina talks about her recent mission trip to the Philippines and Singapore as well as prophecies about Asia and other nations. We need to continue to confess and profess His perfect word and will. Do not empower any fear mongering or darkness the enemy is trying to spread. The youth of the nations are getting stirred up by the Holy Spirit. Let us continue to be excited!"
