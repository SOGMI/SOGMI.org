hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso with freedom Fellowship Church and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time Pastor Chris is still in the Philippines and she's going to actually be there till the beginning of the next month so until then I'm going to be filling in for her and before we get started I just want to give you a quick update of the things that are happening overseas we've gotten a chance to talk with Pastor Chris on multiple occasions and the report that she has been saying over the past several weeks has been very very encouraging she's held multiple leadership conferences business conferences and for the first time ever she's held the prophetic gathering of the Saints in multiple cities across the Philippines which is the end-of-the-year event that we held in San Antonio December 31st what she's been saying is really exciting she's saying that the Philippine people are really excited to hear what the Lord has to say she has said that basically their shouts of exclamation are deafening that there's thousands thousands of leaders young Christian leaders that have all banded together to hear what the Lord has to say in addition there have been hundreds of salvations many people getting filled with the holy spirit for the first time and miracles miraculous miracles that have manifested over in the Philippines so if you've sowed a seed towards this trip that's part of your seed and I just want to start this broadcast off with encouraging you that God is moving God is moving in the Philippines and it has even been said that while miraculous manifestations and miracles happen in the Philippines the same will happen in the u.s. here in San Antonio here in Texas what we need to do is we need to prepare our hearts for it and we need to seek after God so that he can move mightily I know I want to see God move Meraki in the United States amen one of the stories that Pastor Chris told us while she was talking to us about the things that were happening over there involved this young boy who she actually met last year when she was in the Philippines there was this young boy he was maybe 7 to 10 years old but he was hit by a motorcycle that was trying to go around this truck and he was hit very hard when he was some to the hospital to be taken care of immediately and what happened is that the doctors told the parents that his chance of survival was very slim he was in severe pain he couldn't lay down he couldn't sit up he couldn't eat he couldn't do anything without being an intense severe pain which for a boy that's that young it's very heartbreaking to see such a young individual going through so much pain but what happened is that Pastor Chris went to the hospital she laid hands on him he became filled with the Holy Spirit and she told him that as he prays in the spirit Healing will come and when the boy when he started to pray in the spirit he was able to actually rest for the first time in a long time so fast forward to the present when Pastor Chris returned to that same city during one of the service here comes this boy running to her and giving her a hug isn't that miraculous this was a boy who the doctors had said that he was going to die and here he is running without any physical impairments so praise God and that's just one of the many stories that Pastor Chris shared with us while she's in the Philippines and this is all a part of our seat every healing every salvation every miraculous manifestation that happens overseas in the Philippines by being one of our partners that's part of your seed so brothers and sisters we have many seeds in the ground and it's very exciting to see what God is going to do in this nation amen so last week we celebrated Valentine's Day many people took their significant others out to dinner bought them gifts flowers everybody knows how it is there's an interesting statistic I actually want to share with you last year the National Retail Federation took a poll and they basically took a poll to see what the average spending on Valentine's Day is for that holiday and what they discovered was that an estimated of eighteen point nine billion dollars was spent on Valentine's Day last year in 2015 that's a lot of money that's an average of $142 per spender so it's really interesting to see because one that shows that so many people are so willing to go the extra mile spend time and resources to build up the relationships that they have with other people and that's really encouraging that's really good to hear that people are willing to invest time and money into their relationships but one thing that we stop to think about if we fellowship church is how often do we do the same for Jesus how many resources how much time are we investing to build that<split> relationship because if we think about it the greatest love of all happened on the cross when Jesus gave his life for us as the Bible says there is no greater love than to give one's life for a friend so how much have we given to build our relationship with Jesus and that's something we stop to think about a freedom Fellowship Church in fact our Valentine's Day service was entirely dedicated to loving on Jesus it was actually quite beautiful to see everybody went all out everybody came to the service with love offerings to give to Jesus the entire podium the stage was decorated with flowers that have been brought by people some people prepared a special song others prepared to dance some people wrote love letters to Jesus all of it from the heart to show our love for Jesus but that's something to think about in all this time that we spend loving on one another that we're willing to give to one another sometimes Jesus gets overlooked and I feel like that should not be the case in fact I don't just feel that way but I know that that shouldn't be the case so while we go about our day why don't we stop to think about what we can do to love on Jesus and to develop that relationship something that God impressed upon my heart was the need to build a desire that longing desire to know him more there's a psalm of David it's Psalm 63 starting with verse 1 David is riding up to God when he was in the desert of Judah he says you God are my god earnestly I seek you I thirst for you my whole being longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory because your love is better than life isn't that true my lips will glorify you I will praise you as long as I live and in your name I will lift up my hands I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods with singing lips my mouth will praise you now that's very strong passionate language that David had says just stop to think about that I thirst for you my whole being longs for you see this is an idea that we long for God so much that we are physically affected by it and then he goes on to say because your love is better than life and that's such a true statement because there is no greater love than the love of Jesus in fact it is through the love of God that we can come to know love in its fullness so let's stop to think about the love of God the Bible says in Romans 5 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us now let's think about that while we still had all of those issues all of those problems while we were still a mess God looked at us with love with loving eyes that saw us for what we could be and it's when we come to know that love that we can start to look at other people that way and that's really what the Christian walk is about it's about taking the love that God has given us and then showering other people with that same love amen another thing that Pastor Chris has been talking about is that this year manifestations are being accelerated that the blessings of God that supernatural manifestations are coming forth but the thing is is that if we focus on the manifestations if we focus on the things we want then they're not going to manifest why because anything that we put before God is an idol anything that we raise up above him in priority that is an idol however as she has said on multiple occasions and this is scriptural if we focus on the things of God the things that we have been waiting for to manifest will manifest so quickly this year in 2016 but we can't allow ourselves to take over we can't allow our mind to take over we need to allow God to lead us and guide us if we just focus on God he'll take care of things for us he has our best interest but what happens the things that we care about the most are the things that we're least willing to give up but what does that say about us it says that we don't trust God God you can have this God you can have that but this thing right here I don't trust you with that I'm going to do my own thing because when you do the thing that God is not telling you to do in that place that means you don't trust him it means that you're not willing to let him take over of every area of your life but the thing is we don't just say that Jesus is our Savior do we know we say that he is our Lord and our Savior so it's not enough that he died for our sins and took the punishment for us now we need to allow him to become the Lord of our lives and brothers and sisters if we do that he is willing and able to take care of our every need what did David say in that scripture that I just read in Psalm 65 he said I will praise you as long as I live and in your name I will lift up my hands I will be fully satisfied as with<split> the richest of foods with singing lips my mouth will praise you fully satisfied with the richest see for God it's not just enough to satisfy us but he wants to give us the richest of the foods the richest of things to enjoy for those who focus in obey Him another example take the words of Jesus himself in Matthew chapter 6 starting with verse 25 he says therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more than food and the body more than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or stow away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they can any one of you by worrying at a single hour to your life and why do you worry about clothes see how the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet I tell you that not even Solomon and all of his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own see we need to stop spending so much time worrying about this worrying about that in all these things if we would take that energy that we spend in worrying and focusing on God then we would be not only more productive but then God would have free reign to take care of those things in our lives because we finally took our hand off of it and really that's one of the biggest things that stops manifestations from coming in is that we get in the way you see God takes care of all the plants all the animals so so much more for us and for we are created in His image in his likeness and so much more for those of us that have accepted him into our hearts does this make sense to you brothers and sisters so we need to stop fretting we need to stop toiling but focus on God it doesn't James if we draw near to God He will draw near to us and all God wants is our time all God wants is our love our affection and our obedience what do we say so often in this ministry for our language is love and our currency is faith and obedience to Jesus Christ so let us act out those things let us act that out we don't need to worry about all the troubles of life if we focus on God if we go before the Lord ask him God what do I need to do today God what do I need to be doing now if we obey God then he's going to take care of the rest God is not like many people can be many people can be unreliable but God when he tells you to do something is not gonna leave you out to fend for yourself no if you obey the Lord he will take care of every step along the way and prepare you so let's put energy towards loving on God towards drawing near to God amen another thing that Pastor Chris said and this is along the same lines is that we cannot live 2016 like 2015 the same routines the same patterns the same way of thinking that's all gone 2016 is a year where we've been given a clean slate brothers and sisters so any mistakes of the past any old issues we need to slay it down before God and allow that to be done and away with and not pick it up again the clean slate is what's allowing this accelerated manifestation to come forth amen so it's an exciting year so we need to love on God we need to get out of the way get out of the way and we need to drop any issues of the past and the old patterns and the old ways of thinking and we can't expect God to move a certain way but that goes again back to getting our mind out of the way as pastor Chris talked about last week what do we know about the Pharisees she talked about how the Pharisees knew the scriptures they knew the prophecies that were in the Old Testament about the Messiah right they were scholars they studied it for years and years and years that was their entire existence that was their entire profession but when the Messiah came and was fulfilling all of those prophecies they didn't recognize him they didn't accept him and why is that because he didn't fit their preconceived ideas on what the Messiah was supposed to look like what this Messiah was supposed to act like he didn't fit what they assumed it would be like and if we're not careful that's what the move of God might be like for us if we aren't attentive and if we don't get out of the way so we can't assume that God is gonna act a certain way or that he's not gonna act a certain way Pastor Chris<split> has said on multiple occasions 20:16 God is taking us to a place that we've never been before never been before so I don't care how God moved in the past I don't care what God did in the past any good any bad that happened it doesn't matter because this is a new season this is a brand new start so we can't assume that God's gonna act a certain way we need to go before God and ask God where do you need me to be now what step do I need to take now and if we focus on God if we focus on where he wants us to be I believe we're going to see miraculous moves in this country and men signs and wonders are happening overseas brothers and sisters it's time they started happening here in the u.s. God has already started revival inside the hearts of many in the u.s. let's start to see miraculous signs wonders manifestations happening amen before we go let me pray with you dear friendly father god I lift up each and every one of these listeners God and I pray Lord that they would think about these words and that would take to heart the things that have been shared on this broadcast lord I think you got for opening up God a fire of love a fire of revival a passion a burning passion that they would physically yearn for your presence Lord that they would have a desire so strong Lord that they will seek after you Lord I thank you God for working out floored any preconceived ideas got any preconceived notions Lord of how you are going to move but lord I thank you that you are going to move mightily you're going to move so strong in each and every one of their lies Lord and I thank you God for the miraculous manifestations that are already on their way Lord in the name of Jesus God I think you got four restorations of families Lord I think you got four healed limbs Lord I thank you God for healing from sickness illnesses viruses Lord in the name of Jesus Lord I thank you God for a restoration of finances Lord restoration of relationships Lord in the name of Jesus I call them forth and I thank you God that all of these things are for your glory and for your honor Lord in the name of Jesus amen and it's true it is all for his glory and that's the last thing I want to leave you with is that remember why God wants to bless us because it's not only for ourselves although we will benefit it is for the glory of the Lord and to bring even more people to Christ we ought to be radiating so much with the love of God and the blessings of the Lord that other people can't help to take notice so before we go I just want to leave you with the scripture numbers 6 22 through 27 this is God speaking to Moses then the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to Aaron and his son saying thus you shall bless the sons of Israel you will say to them the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace so they shall invoke my name on the sons of Israel and I shall bless them you see we ought to be a reflection of the love of the Lord and that's where this comes forth what has been said about this year pastors Chris has said on multiple occasions this year we're gonna look good we're gonna feel good we're gonna do good and we're gonna be good all for the glory of God well where does this come from it comes from when we focus on God His goodness his glory and his blessing becomes reflected upon us we become a year for him that's where the looking good comes from that's where the feeling good comes from that's where the doing good comes from people are gonna see it on our countenance it's gonna be all over our face it's gonna be all over our expression so let's make it happen let's start reflecting on the world so that they'll look at us and they'll see God working in us amen well as I said before Pastor Chris is still in the Philippines so it's not too late to sow a seed to this mission trip we still have expenses to pay and it's a fertile ground so if you want to still so a seed to the Philippine mission trip it's not too late go to our website as soon as you can you will see a button on the top right hand corner that says donate from there it will take you to our PayPal link where you can pay online and give money to our ministry and you can specify that you want it for the Philippine mission in the notes section so again it's not too late it's a fertile ground we are hearing so many great stories about what God is doing overseas in the Philippines if you'd like to join us on one of our services we meet every Sunday at 10 a.m. and every Sunday evening at 7 p.m. we also have a Wednesday service Wednesday prayer service at 7 p.m. our facility is located at 80 419 Callahan Road off IH-10 in San Antonio Texas you can find more<split> information on our website at www.sogmi.org also give us a call call us at 210-695-1630 we love to hear from you guys it's always so encouraging to hear about how this radio broadcast is affecting you listeners and how it's touched you and how God is moving in your lives if you have any testimonies about some miraculous manifestation about something that God has done in your life don't hesitate to call us
