god bless you for tuning in hello this is Christina Sosso of freedom fellowship church and sons of god international and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time glory to God before I begin I want to welcome for very special people from the Philippines who are visiting here in Texas welcome pastors Dan and Lear yoke Otto and brother ed and his lovely wonderful wife jasmine SP no let us give them a big Jesus Texas welcome Zoe they traveled and they have been traveling with me in the Philippines ministering and they are part of one of the greatest relief efforts we've had in this ministry for the flood victims they've been with us on healing Crusades and pastors and leadership training as often as they can they are with us they always take care of me and Divina while there especially when we ran out of money brother ed is a builder a civil engineer and a successful one too he always provide help provide the trucks and drivers during any of our initiative just like the flood relief effort that we've had in the past and he even matched some of the supplies we provided he is really a financial in the body of Christ and he and his wife are about ready to receive the greatest manifestations of God's blessing they are part of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence one thing I can say about these two couples the more they are blessed by God the more blessings manifest in their life the more humble they get and the more they they really take care of me now that the Lord sends them here in San Antonio to fellowship but at the same time to receive to be the first recipient of the prophetic words the creative words from the Philippines on what God is about to do in that country and also in their personal life the country of my birth I got the best of both worlds the rich culture of the Philippines beautiful people friendly people and United States of America as an American it is a privilege for me to live in the greatest country in the world I thank God for our founding fathers and we need to continue to protect and pray for America we need to continue to finance the preaching of the gospel to all nations and we need to continue to finance in making disciples so heed Jasmine Pastor Dan Anna Cheng Vireo the colossal Ahmad kept a young man I am glad that you're part of my family God's family in the Philippines pasa lomatin king upon Janaki a young man now expect the manifestations of God's blessings in your life of the manifestation of God's glory in your life your family and the beautiful country of the Philippines so as a Texan I've been here in Texas for 36 years so where will I take them of course first of all you have to feed them that's a texas-style barbecue I'll take them to the Riverwalk show them the Alamo probably drive them to the Hill Country probably go to Dallas and Houston and take them to NASA since brother ed is a builder I can't wait to take him to some of the subdivisions and model homes and nice hotels here in Texas you should see the auditorium he built in the Philippines in some of the office buildings and hotels he is really good he's anointed also I just want to give you an opportunity I will be holding a prophetic conference and leadership training and evangelistic Crusades in the Philippines the prophetic conference will be just like we just held here in San Antonio but it's going to be much much bigger ok I will be leaving on the third week of November after Thanksgiving you my brothers and sisters it is time for you to help finance the Great Commission it's time for you to sow a seed in this ministry ok those money that you kept on holding on are starting to corrode better let them lose and start sowing seeds for the kingdom of God look at the investment we sowed in foreign soil and this country because we continue to sow seeds in other countries we receive a political revival in this country and now the wickedness in this country has reached fullness especially in the media in the arts and entertainment in the world and now the Lord is dealing those sectors of society as well as our government it is because of our prayers of our returning to God our obeying God and ministries like sons of God international continue to sow seeds and we continue to finance the gospel you need to be a part of this endeavor <split>continue to be aggressive in sowing because you would not want to have any regrets a few weeks from now a few months from now because we will going to witness and be a part of the greatest move of God through the church and in the church and in this country like we'd never have heard before so now probably you're feeling that changes more changes more changes promotion and manifestation this year God is amazing for those of you are wondering why summer seems to be hanging on and would not let go it is our fault here at freedom faucet charts we received instruction at the beginning of the year even during the prophetic gathering of the Saints and also during the spring of the things that we need to finish the things that we need to do during summer many things and some of us if not all of us were not able to do them all so I was in prayer one time apologizing to the Lord and at the same time thanking him for this year what he is doing what he's about ready to do and that I promised him that I will continue to tell others to complete the words that were assigned to us especially here at freedom Fellowship Church and the Lord spoke to me and said Christina I am extending summer for you he is awesome well if you say God will not talk like that he just did God will not do that he just did and I am grateful so the Lord extended the summer hope everything will be finished before it gets cold so once it is finished cold front are allowed to come okay but we need to do our part if you will not do your part then cold front is coming whether that addition is finished or not and we still have three months remaining this year and I'm still running and I'm still going so many opportunities so many testimonies so many manifestations prophecies being fulfilled it is such an exciting year so continue to stay tuned especially for our new radio listeners at Kady ry my brothers and sisters listen up because God is on the move okay so stay tuned God is doing something so awesome so unprecedented and unheard-of we all need to go higher and deeper in the things of God okay we need to allow the Holy Spirit to teach us let me explain something to you as you face challenges right now some are in impossible situation some have difficult issues painful issues that you're confronting right now the main thing that you need to do is to tell God that you trust him and then do the right thing do godly things do what you can do do not wait for a favorable condition before you obey and believe God do what you can right now continue to move forward you can do all the things that you can do okay if you can do everything yourself if you can afford your project or your initiative if you can resolve your problem you do not need God when it comes to his children our Father God is needy he wants to get involved because why when he is involved he's always dramatic he always produces supernatural results as I explained to you last week prophetic words released during the conference are powerful they are creative bird calling those things as though they were in accordance to the plan and the will of our loving God they are beyond understanding they are beyond comprehension you cannot make the manifest based on your own strength knowledge or resources they are from heaven released here on earth upon your life so that you will live heaven here on earth it will take for God to make them manifest and all it will take for our God to move in order for them to manifest and all he needs from you is your trust is your faith and your cooperation obey your instruction confess and profess his word and trust him don't look at your situation don't look at yourself look upon him now let me get back to your own challenges to your own personal prophecy to your problem right now to your dilemma okay keep in mind that God wants to get in the picture when your situation is impossible or he wants to take you higher and deeper okay God always called the unqualified because he qualifies the cult it is that how much you know and how smart or good-looking or rich you are it is who you are in him focus on who he is he is amazing and I am in love with him he's my first love God always produces dramatic results and let me show you example remember Lazarus and his two sisters Martha and Mary Lazarus got seriously ill and the two sisters sent or to Jesus in John chapter 11 verse 3 so the sisters sent word to Jesus and said Lord the one you love is sick John chapter 11 verse 4 when he Jesus heard this jesus said this sickness will not end in death he prophesied No it is for God's glory so that God's son may be glorified through it I want you to keep this in mind John chapter 11 verse 4 when he heard this jesus said this sickness will not end in death no<split> it is for God's glory so that God's son may be glorified through it Jesus prophesied No this sickness will not end in death it doesn't matter if he stopped breathing it doesn't matter even if they burned him and for a reason it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it your healing did not manifest right away because Jesus already healed you and I at the cross right when you're healing do not manifest right away or your prophecy did not come to pass right away or your situation is not resolved right away so that God may be glorified by believing and trusting God God the Father may glorify you like Jesus keep in mind that there are always three results when it is a move of God when it is from God when it's the plan of God when it's the will of God when it's the Word of God okay three results you're always look for this and if this three are in the picture you rest assured that it is from God number one God gets the glory number two it will benefit you or it will also glorify you personally and third it will benefit others it will benefit God's people so it is not just yourself okay but always this three has to happen there always have to be in the mix okay so let us continue in John chapter 11 down to verse 6 this is Jesus yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days he increased the pressure to the pressure okay so I don't want anyone panicking because we are partakers of the divine nature of God God never never ever ever panic okay so when he heard that Lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days and in verse 11 when they're on their way on the fourth day jesus told his disciples in verse eleven our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going there to wake him up they thought that he was just taking a nap okay so Jesus waited for two more days waited until Lazarus stopped breathing why to fulfill all these three requirements Jesus glorified God the Father God the Father through the Holy Spirit glorified Jesus and it benefited Lazarus the people who were there and the two sisters everyone was in awe of Jesus that Lazarus was raised from the dead instead of a funeral arrangement they had a party instead I want you to keep that in mind my dear brothers and sisters believe God even though you caused the problem as long as you already made it right don't continue on sinning but : God and ask for forgiveness repent don't do it again and then jump on on it it doesn't matter if it's your fault you are God's child and he will come to the picture he gets the glory it will benefit you and it will benefit others okay Abraham and Sarah remember here is God he is so dramatic I love it I love it he chose to senior citizens in addition to that even Sarah was still burn when she was young to make things more dramatic God instructed Abraham to leave his father's house leave his own country just like that just to take him to where he never dreamed possible outside of God so Abraham obeyed and while even as soon as they continued to move forward on their way to the promised land wherever it was Lord started blessing them financially right and then God promised Abraham all the nations of the earth will be blessed and Abraham complained to God that's true it good but I don't have anyone to leave all these blessings I don't have a son and God said you will have a son right through Sarah and Sarah's already it can be a great-great grandmother at that time so just like you and I sometimes I I stopped doing that okay Sarah I started analyzing things okay she said uh-uh there's no way I'm too old so it makes sense to give my servant Hagar who is good-looking and young she can get pregnant right away and propose it to Abraham and they got Ishmael instead of Isaac God did not say what was I thinking Abraham was really old and Sarah is old and barren what Isis thinking no it postponed the promise through Isaac for many years but in spite of them using common sense God who remains faithful still fulfilled his promise you see God will not get the glory if Abraham was young if Sarah is young and Sarah will be on childbearing age and she's not barren God will not get the glory anyone can have children anyone can do that right so guy will not get the glory so the three elements are not there but with Abraham believing God all the three elements God gets the glory right and then Abraham and Sarah benefited from it and God's people the whole world benefited because of Abraham's faithfulness and righteousness so the three elements are there it has to be an impossible situation for you in order for God to bring dramatic supernatural results okay another one the multiplications of loaves and fishes if Jesus held that crusade here in San Antonio and the people were hungry how many Mexican<split> restaurants we have here in San Antonio of course we can order thousands of tacos for everybody or even fried chicken or pizza for everybody barbecue are you serious no the multiplications up loads and fishes have got to be in a remote place that even when you have the money you cannot get or buy anything to eat that kind of situation then your situation will bring glory to God and here's Jesus giving them simple instruction have everyone sit on a group of fifty he took the bread thanked father God and then instructed the disciples to give everyone a piece everyone was full and satisfied and there were 12 baskets full of leftovers now that is traumatic God loves drama so whatever you're dealing with right now don't analyze all you need to do is faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and follow simple instructions is going to give you what instruction I didn't get an instruction as the Holy Spirit read the Bible okay so it's time for you to manifest dramatic results for your life so don't forget we're holding the prophetic gathering of the Saints on December 31st it's time for you to register start saving money registration is $60 per person that will pay
