description: "We are expecting God’s move in a supernatural and mind-boggling way. And before I give you two prophecies for the body of Christ for 2019 and beyond, I want to emphasize the timing of the Lord and the ways of the Lord in these last days, this year 2019 and beyond. Several weeks ago, I shared with you the vision that God gave me for 2019, what He’s planning on doing for 2019 and beyond. The ways of the world, there’s a system. You can call it “Deep State”, you can call it “babylonian system” that has been planted in Washington, D.C. and has taken a deep root that goes to the center of the Earth, and several roots in all the continents of the world are feeding off this root."
