description: "When you love someone—when you are in love with someone— you consider them in all of your choices. This is how we must love God. When we grow our personal relationship with Him, that is when we can fully follow Him, because we know deep in our hearts that anywhere He takes us is the best place we can go. God is on the move, let us pursue Him."
