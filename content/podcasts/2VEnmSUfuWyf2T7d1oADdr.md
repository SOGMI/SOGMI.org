description: "Every place Jesus went, and everything He did was ordained by God. We need to do the same in our own life. Lay aside your own agendas and decide that you will passionately seek Him; draw near to Him and He will draw near to youâ€”He cannot help Himself. You will get the direction you need by dwelling in His presence, even down to the littlest details. Let God create the vision and equip you to do it."
