description: "“There are so many prophecies... taking place right now… Many many issues, global issues [challenges], have been here... for many many years, but now we can see victory, we can see resolution of these challenges. Same thing with your life. Believe that God can manifest…This is God’s intent, this is His will: be a blessing to others. He will bless you to be a blessing.” Psalm 144:12-15, John 16:12-14, Psalm 145"
