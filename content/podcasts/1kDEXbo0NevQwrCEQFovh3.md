description: "We must continue to focus on the promises of God and where He is leading us. It is our responsibility as Christians to be the light to the world. This means we should be a transformative force wherever we go; when light comes, darkness has to scatter. The light never has to concern itself with darkness, so let us stop complaining about the wicked and see things in our culture through the promise of God. Let us be like the two spies, Joshua and Caleb, that brought back a good report; let us believe God and act accordingly."
