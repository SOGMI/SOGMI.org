hello thank you for tuning in this is Joshua Sosso and you are listening to the prophetic voice of our time god bless you brothers and sisters I'm very excited to share with you this message today but before we begin I just want to give you guys a quick reminder we celebrated Passover the other week yes so that means that the Feast of the harvest and the day of Pentecost is another 50 days following that so we need to prepare our hearts we need to prepare our minds and prepare our spirits to receive what God has for us during the feast of harvest it also means during the feast of harvest that we need to be willing to give our first fruits to God but you see during this feast that's when God poured out his Holy Spirit on the disciples who are in the upper room so it's a very significant time and I just want to remind you guys that we are in that 50 day window right now so let's keep focused on God and let's keep focused on the task he's giving us a hand so what we're going to be talking about today is how we need to take a hold of the things that God has given us this is something that Pastor Chris said last Wednesday she said that our faith has to be a force faith isn't something that's passive faith isn't something that's idly by our faith needs to be a force in the spiritual realm it needs to have presence which means that when we're believing for God to do something when we're praying about something our faith needs to move the mountains our faith needs to move to slay the principalities it needs to uproot the plans of the devil the plans of the enemy and needs to have an impact around its surrounding area and so that means that the things that we're believing God about we need to take a hold of them and it's not just enough to stand and believe on those things no we need to take a hold of it and we need to decree we need to proclaim we need to believe God and we need to act according to our faith so our faith needs to be a presence and we're actually going to be sharing a sermon that Pastor Chris shared with us about using the words that God has given you the words that God has spoken over your life using those things as a weapon to combat the enemy as in taking those words that God has given you those words from the Lord even the words in the scripture and using them to fight spiritual warfare so without further ado here is Pastor Chris just keep in mind so that it will inspire you and compel you when you do spiritual warfare because the battle starts in the minds of people that we are created in the image of God that when we speak words we call those things as though they were that's what prophecy is all about so it's really important for us to really drop everything that we know about the Lord and ask the Holy Spirit to take us to the next level of intimate relationship because you and I have to really live and think and walk to the reality that we belong to the household of God we don't have to earn anything right and you need to renounce it doesn't matter you need to renounce everything that you have with man's frequency of ideas and who God is because we're putting an image of who God is and the nature of God in our mind and we start talking about it and if we continue to do that we tend to forget that God was not created it doesn't belong into our own image or perception of him we are created in His own image it's the other way around and God is not created after me own thinking or own image because without God we still belong to the Babylonian system we are not born again and that's why mankind have a wrong perceptions of God it's either God is cruel it's either God is that involve anymore and I could even hear some people saying that the power of Satan is equal as the power of God I mean that is blasphemy the stupid Spirit came upon them so in addition to their ignorance what are going to do but it is important in our days and in our minds now that we need to remind ourselves that's why God kept on reminding us over and over again through the Holy Spirit that we really need to remember and rehearse all the prophecies that were given to us that were released for the church for the nations and and for us especially right because it is important the book of Ephesians that our warfare is not about flesh and blood right it's about the spiritual forces in the heavenly realms and at the same time he said that you know what your weapons are not carnal but they are mighty in pulling down what is strongholds of the enemy and we need to pull those things down because every time the destiny of God that is upon you it's not what you think it's not really what you think is going to be because you have not conceived the plan of God upon your life when it concerning this are very concerning that aspects of life even if you<split>'re doing everything that you have in your power applying the Word of God right and the personal prophecy will come to you in a way that hey you're doing what is right you believe God but this is the way you walk in it it is prophetic words that point to the system of God that God's ways of doing things to the narrow straight road it always points to Jesus Christ it is not about your glory isn't about your fame isn't about your reputation it's about the reputation of God so when we receive prophecy we need to understand that when prophecy is released upon you it is not just for you to stand and believe stand on the word and believe please understand me look at me you need to use that word and knowledge above God and who you are in Christ Jesus as a part of your engaging in warfare it is part of your weapon because you know God will tell you something and you know the facts are so different right the facts what you see what you hear or what you're feeling and what you know what happened and didn't happen they're exactly the opposite of what the DA says the Lord says right so it is important for us the knowledge of who you are and what God is giving you and instructing you for 2016 and beyond and about your life you use that a spiritual warfare starting with a battle of your own mind right because it is so totally different well God has put this desire in my heart so therefore he's planning on manifesting it that is true but you need the personal prophecy you need the dust saith the Lord the Word of God to direct you and said no no no no no that's the world's ways of doing things that is not the way this is the way and you have to walk in it and that's why it is important for the prophetic words to manifest right now are you getting this I've been engaging in Spritle warfare with our nation with this knowledge the things that you see in the news the things that you're seeing as far as the facts are concerned it doesn't really agree that the fact that God is going to bring political revival in this country and righteousness will be upon this country right but what you see what you hear what is happening what is being said what is being told in the news they're entirely opposite of what we're receiving so it is important for us to get the Word of God there will be political revival in this country and that is warfare you call those things as though they were and God already released prophetic words now it's time for us to engage in warfare you pray in the spirit said oh no Lord your word is mighty in pulling down strongholds that is our weapon you said political revival is in this country and this country is going to turn around this country is going to turn around for the glory of your name and said I come in agreement with you and then you pray you pray not oh let's fast and pray let's repair it'll be I said stop it how many times have you repented already and you did not repent those are mere words but this is action that it has to come from our spirit and release and said we are not going to receive anything except the will of the Father upon this nation are you getting this and then you start you invest time in praying instead of moaning and groaning and saying negative words about the candidate so what's going on then you're still in the world system you're still picking and eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the Tree of Life so in this thing our warfare they are not carnal so your release and said no political revival is coming into this country in the name of Jesus Lord our prayer the prayer of your people we are at the helm they may be in power they may be in authority but in the name of Jesus our authority is in heaven and here on earth and that can unleash the legions of angels the angelic hosts to fight on our behalf and it is the anointing it is our declaration it is our resolve in our fight to release those words so that God is said ok there are on position I can manifest it now are you getting this instead of just waiting well I wish I'm going to receive a word the prophetic words from Pastor Chris today so that it will confirm what you already know it already confirmed what you already know let's get to the next level let's fight let's fight with our personal prophecy let's fight for this country with the prophesy towards United States of America and let us remind God and let us thank God that people from all over the world are fighting also and praying for United States of America to take its leadership and don't even say that oh we have come to the point of no return that America have lost soul I haven't have you freedom Fellowship charts is alive and well and still in authority are you getting this so prophecies are from above they are from God who is in heaven and the Holy<split> Spirit gives the utterance as he heard and seen it in the heavenly realms keep that in mind we need the Holy Spirit to guide us this day John 14:26 but the counselor the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you John 16:13 but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears God is everywhere the Holy Spirit is God he is not your servant he is God so he hears from where he is here on the earth as a deposit from God the Father and God the Son but he is everywhere he's also in heaven so he hears the conversation between God the Father and God the Son so he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come and then you had to remind yourself in Ephesians 2:6 God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus right okay and then 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 19 through 21 and we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it we need to pay attention to what is being prophesied not just in your personal prophets the prophecy to the nation prophecy to the church what is a prophecy to the church transfer of wealth influence influence will manifest when the political revival manifests it is as important for you to pray and to receive the transfer of wealth and to prepare for it it is as important to continue to release the words of proclamation and decree in the name of Jesus that our country will experience a political revival that this country will turn around towards righteousness it is as important as your personal prophecy okay because whatever happened to the nation or to the church it will affect you personally okay and we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts above all you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man keep that in mind but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit and why is this important for us to pay attention and to follow the prophecy to the church it is more important to us than our own personal prophecy his intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms heavenly realms what is Ephesians 1:3 said God gave us all the riches in what heavenly realms so the manifold wisdom of God if we allow the Holy Spirit to guide us into all things and is as important for us for the church to follow the instruction then the manifold wisdom of God many fold wisdom of God not just the wisdom of God it comes in layers that it will be what manifests through the church that's the function of the church not releasing judgment not looking for faults of its other you don't have to look any further if you're trying to find faults look at yourself in the mirror so we don't have to be content with that but instead we bring forth and partake from the fruit of the tree of life which is the Word of God Christ Jesus this is the church the church is the fruit of the tree of life right because when Jesus is as curse is every man that hung on a tree am I correct Jesus hang himself in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that's why he said when we look at the cross it is not just for our sin it means to say that Jesus hang himself on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that we will have life and have it abundantly he made a spectacle if they have known they will not have crucified our Lord Jesus Christ but they thought that they have won because they hang him from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and here he is the manifold wisdom of God was hidden from them but for us every time we study every time we meditate on what Jesus did on the cross we get to know more of him and about him and we get to love him more our trust and our confidence is in him and then we get to know ourselves we walk in confidence that oh no I may have eight as my snack the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and I have a stomach upset afterwards but you know what this is the Temple of the Holy Spirit that has been destroyed thousands of years ago so I'm not subject to it so you need to fight and engage in spiritual warfare in the knowledge of the dust saith the Lord that's your tree of life and you're dealing with you're looking at all the evidence that is contrary to what God is telling you your sword is the Word of God right that's your<split> weapon so you need to sit like no I'm not moved by the facts I'm moved by the truth and Jesus is the truth right we are in a warfare it is not just me you have to engage you have to engage for your own good and for the glory of God you have to engage to protect and at the same time occupy your inheritance your territory your promised land are you getting this remember numerous times I think since 2004 when the Lord had me teach this about the spirit of Joshua and the spirit of Caleb and I'm getting into this the Holy Spirit asked me this question you know a teacher you have to pass the test why did yo schewe chosen to succeed Moses instead of Caleb and that is a valid question but I told the Holy Spirit I said Lord I have never thought about that so I went back and researched it just as a shortcut it is good to have a spirit of Caleb because whatever the situation is whatever the circumstances is he said like oh no it is God who gave us the promised land who cares about the giant right I'll have them for breakfast right who cares about that I'm focused on the big grapes and the land flowing with milk and honey and he never deviated from that right same thing with Joshua but Joshua never talked about the inheritance in the promised land like Caleb he was busy attaching himself to Moses so that when God appeared to Moses he's gonna be there are you getting this he's going to be there and at the same time he served Moses so it says in the scripture that when God spoke to Moses face to face and one time the Lord spoke to him and then he was commanded to go and tell the people what God has instructed Moses to say or to deliver it says in the scripture Joshua the son of nun stayed why it is important for us to have the spirit of Caleb I'm not knocking him down but it is more important to hold on to the promise of God and to walk in following your instruction and afraid and at the same time following and desiring intimacy and the presence of God in your life that's the difference so Joshua was chosen to succeed Moses because he sought after the presence of the Lord I want to share with you the passage from which Pastor Chris was quoting you can find this story in Exodus chapter 33 starting with verse 7 it says now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away calling it the tent of meeting anyone inquiring of the Lord would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp and whenever Moses went out to the tent all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents watching Moses as he entered the tent as Moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud would come and stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses whenever the people saw the pillar of clouds standing at the entrance to the tent the Lord would speak to Moses face-to-face as one speaks to a friend then Moses would return to the camp but his young aide Joshua son of nun did not leave the tent so why did he do this as Pastor Chris said it's because he was so infatuated so possessed by the presence of the Lord that he didn't want to leave and Moses he had to leave since he had to share the words that the Lord has spoken to the people of Israel but Joshua didn't have to go so when Moses left Joshua instead of following Moses decided to linger in the presence of the Lord and so from this message we need to retain two things one it's that we have to use the words from the Bible the Word of God and the words spoken prophetically over us that the Lord has told us as a weapon to enact spiritual warfare this includes our personal lives this includes what the Lord has spoken over this nation what the Lord has spoken over the church we need to use those words as a weapon to wage war and the other thing that we need to understand that while it's good to have a spirit of Caleb since Caleb knew the promises of the Lord took ahold of them and was not fazed by any of the obstacles right so that is good it's good to have a spirit of Caleb but it's even better to have a spirit of Joshua to where you're not even focused so much on what the Lord has promised the church promises nation promised you personally you're focused on the presence of the Lord above all us pleasing God above all else that is the Joshua spirit to seek God's presence more than anything else well we're about out of time for today before we go I just want to remind you that we are in that 50-day period leading up to the Feast of the harvest the day of Pentecost so keep that in mind continue to praise God that he is moving in the earth today also be sure to check out our
