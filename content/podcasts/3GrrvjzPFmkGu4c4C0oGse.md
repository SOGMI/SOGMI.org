description: "It says in Revelation 11:15 that ‘...The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.’ So it is important for us. We must develop a new mindset. We must meditate on all the good things from God… God has entrusted us to bring about global changes in this world by implementing His ways of doing things and hearing his voice and we obey that voice, and it will be easier when you meditate on the good things of God."
