description: "We need to value the calling of God. We must be willing to surrender everything, even what is dear to us, in pursuit of what God is calling us to do. Remember that the treasure He is trying to give us is far greater than anything we could imagine. So trust God and do not let men dissuade you; decide for yourself if you are going to be a spectator, or if you are going to be a part of this great move!"
