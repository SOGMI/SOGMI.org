description: "Just as God called Abraham out from his comfort zone, out from his family to a promised land, so we are being called to a promised land. Some of us are being called to the entertainment sector. Some of us are being called to the business sector. Some of us are being called to education. Some of us are being called to science and technology. Some of us are being called to politics. If God has called you there, that’s your promised land."
