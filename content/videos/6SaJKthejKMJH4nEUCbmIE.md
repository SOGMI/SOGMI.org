description: "Pastor Cris urges us to be on fire for God and tear down our monuments. She starts by talking about looking at the source of any information. Even though we might hear similar prophecies from people, we have to check their fruits so that it's based of God. She also talks about how we can't blame God for something when we don't listen and follow his instructions. She ends by telling us to never feel sorry for ourselves but keep a positive mindset that will produce positive results. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
