description: "This is the time where the Holy Spirit is really trying to speak to us. Pastor Cris continues to share with us to not rely on our opinions, but the truth that God is revealing to us. The Lord is trying to establish us for influence across the world, and that comes through our obedience in the simple things everyday. God gave us all a calling and like Pastor Cris shares, doubting that calling is like doubting God. This sermon was shared at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
