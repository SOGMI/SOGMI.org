description: "There exists two versions future versions of yourself. A version of you that obeyed and followed God and a version of you that didn't. You need to ask yourself what that looks like and whether you are moving towards a future you will be proud of. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 9, 2020.\n"
