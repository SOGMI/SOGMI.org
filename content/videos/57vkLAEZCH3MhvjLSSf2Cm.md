description: "Pastor Cris had a impromptu appearance during this sermon to give us instructions for miracles we are believing for and giving a quick training on praying with authority. Pastor Josh finished off by sharing with us a vision the Lord gave him this past weekend. He said that we need to follow God on his path because all of the obstacles we face will be gone when following God. This is our time to leap into the supernatural!\n"
