description: "Pastor Cristina focused on purification, and how vital it is in these last days to have our hearts, mind and body right with the Lord. It's important to start looking at our current situations, both within our families and environment through the eyes of Christ. Renewal your covenant in you families. Ask the Holy Spirit where to go and do everyday. Stop trying to put our Father into a box, believing that you know how God is going to make something happen, when you don't even know what could happen within the next hour. Purification of your mind, heart and body will bring you to the full authority we have in Christ. As a body we have declared that we are eager to do what is right in our Father's name.\nThis means when God gives you an instruction, you follow it to the letter. Everyone get excited because we are stepping into a new authority, and God has wonderful things in store for us. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Cristina Sosso on March  26, 2023"
