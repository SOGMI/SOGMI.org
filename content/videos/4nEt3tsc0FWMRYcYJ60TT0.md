description: "Many of the Apostles in the early Church were business owners. After being called by God they didn't close their business to go into \"full-time ministry\". However their priorities did get refocused to where the purpose of their business was also to fulfill the Great Commission. Jesus became incorporated into their business. This is how it should be for us in the Transfer of Wealth Influence and Affluence. God will give the vision and He will set the priorities! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 10, 2021."
