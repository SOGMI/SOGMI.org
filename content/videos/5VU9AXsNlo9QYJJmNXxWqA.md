description: "God is using this election to teach us how to partake in spiritual warfare. We get to participate in the process! Remember first and foremost that we do not focus on the negative things, but instead focus on God and His promises. God will be true to His Word. These are the things that we can expect God to do in this time. There will be a period of harvest, restoration, empower, and acceleration, followed by celebration for the goodness of God and things He is doing in the earth. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 11, 2020.\n"
