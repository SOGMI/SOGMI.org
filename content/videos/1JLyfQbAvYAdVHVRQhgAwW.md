description: " A powerful message by Pastor Joshua, of giving up the things that you are withholding from our Father. Many of us have something that we hold back for God. This shows us that we have a level of disbelief and lack of trust. The disciples left everything to follow Christ, because they knew that this was an opportunity that would not come again. They had complete trust in Christ. Because of this sacrifice they we blessed to be sitting at the right side of Christ in heaven. We need to look into ourselves and address this heart issues to find what the root is of this rebellion. The moment we accepted Christ we decided that we are living sacrifices for God. That means everything that we have and desire needs to be given up. Our Father knows our hearts desires. He knows better than us what we want and what we need, so why even worry ourselves with all these worldly things? Jesus said it best, if our Father takes care of the birds of the air and the flowers in the fields, how much more are we of value than them? Give up and let God take the reigns. He's got our backs. Do this and you will realize that what you get in return is far greater than anything you can imagine. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 20, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso   \n"
