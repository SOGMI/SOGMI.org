description: "As we give gifts to our family and friends while celebrating this Christmas season take some time to ask Jesus what he wants for His birthday. This celebration is about Him so let us take time to meet His needs. In Isaiah 9 it tells us that the government will be upon His shoulders. We are going to see the government of God establish in this nation and throughout the earth. This sermon was delivered by Pastors Cristina Sosso and Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 23, 2020."
