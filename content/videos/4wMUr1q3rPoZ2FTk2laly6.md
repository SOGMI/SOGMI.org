description: "Elisha was determined to get the annointing no matter what. We as the Body of Christ should do whatever we can to make the necessary changes. Focus on God's instructions. Focus on His plan. If we place focus on our own desires you limit yourself and limit God's ability to use you. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 10, 2021. It also includes a message for the Philippine Church."
