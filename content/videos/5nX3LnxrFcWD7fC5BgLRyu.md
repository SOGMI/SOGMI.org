description: "This service, Pastor Cris poses an important question, \"If you discovered you only had 12 months left to manifest God's calling in your life would you keep living the way you've been living? Or would you make drastic changes?\" We need to have a sense of urgency. God is bringing the transfer of wealth influence and affluence very soon, and His glory will cover the nations. If you haven't been making changes and implementing what God has been telling you then you are running out of time. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 12, 2022.\n"
