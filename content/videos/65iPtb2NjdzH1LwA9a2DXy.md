description: "Pastor Joshua shared with us tonight three questions we should be asking ourselves, these questions should either be an encouragement or conviction. Question number one, are you allowing yourself to be transformed by God? Your way of thinking, the time you spend, your hobbies should be changing.\nQuestion number two, is your responsibility increasing? This applies to your spiritual walk and your personal life. Just like a promotion at a job, more responsibilities apply, same with the Kingdom if you are not being given more responsibilities. Final question, is your focus on the will of God? Your desires will gravitate towards our Fathers will. Everything you do will be for the glory of our Father. This sermon was released Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 29, 2023 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
