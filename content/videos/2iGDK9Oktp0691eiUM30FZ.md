description: "In what part of your life are you not submitting to the Lord? Is your own mind, or ways of the world affecting your obedience to the Lord? All your trust is to be put into Him. Each and every one of us have been chosen to be a leader in Christ, but none of this can happen if our faith in the Lord is lacking. Each of us need to come face to face with our own leap of faith. Pastor Joshua reminded us that these times are not for you to be half in. You got to be all in or not at all. Every temptation will be thrown at you and it is up to and your Faith, do you trust Him? You can not be given anything that will be neglected, instead you need to attend to that task or property with excellence. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 31, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso"
