description: "On the way to the Promise Land the Israelites focused on their desires. In Exodus chapter 16:3 the Israelites said, \"If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted...\" They were so focused on their desires and needs, that they forgot that God was leading them to a land of abundance. We have to focus on God and remember that He is good and faithful. The Israelites would've only had to wait for a short time if they believed and obeyed God. The 2nd thing that the Israelites focused on was the giants and obstacles. This is also unbelief. We need to push through the discipline process so that God can truly lead is into a place of authority and prosperity. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 14, 2022."
