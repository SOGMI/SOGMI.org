description: "With Passover approaching it's important to know how it's relevant to us Christians today. Jesus took this old tradition and infused it with new life by revealing that He is the Passover Lamb. God has a way of transforming and building upon revelations of the past. This sermon was delivered Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 5, 2020."
