description: "During this service Pastor Cris emphasizes the importance of getting on God's schedule. So many Christians try to make God bend to their schedule and their priorities. This is completely backwards. He is the Lord. We need to submit ourselves to Him in everything that we do. The Transfer of Wealth, Influence and Affluence, will not manifest until we completely submit to God. Until you get into God's schedule you will continue to be in a cycle where you gain some ground and then lose some ground, but you will never truly enter into being in dominion. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 27, 2022."
