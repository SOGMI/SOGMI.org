description: "This evening, Pastor Josh focused on the importance of understanding the call on your life. Like the reference from Matthew 22, \"many are called, but few are chosen.\" That is evident in this day. Since you are called, you have to treat that calling with respect. We have been given instructions these past few weeks to make us ready for the call. We also have to watch our words, because we can rise or fall with what we say. So during this season of suddenly, be quick to listen to the Holy Spirit and slow to speak. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
