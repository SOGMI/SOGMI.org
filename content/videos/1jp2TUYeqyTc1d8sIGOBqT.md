description: "Pastor Ed Grubb discusses the Personality of God and how we can ask the Holy Spirit to guide us in discovering His personality. Afterwards, Pastor Cris discusses the importance of discarding the head knowledge we have become accustomed to and relying firs ton the Holy Spirit. This applies also to how we approach our physical health. Many Christians rely on Doctors, Medical institutions and modern medicines first without seeking God. However, we as Christians should apply Spiritual Principles even concerning our physical health. These sermons were delivered by Ed Grubb and Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Chruch International on December 15, 2021"
