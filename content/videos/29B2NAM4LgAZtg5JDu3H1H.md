description: "Pastor Cris continues her sermon from Sunday Morning about being filled with the Holy Spirit. In Acts 4, Peter and John spoke boldly about the revelation of Jesus Christ despite the threat of being arrested. This was because they were filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit gave them boldness, wisdom, and new revelation. We know this because before being filled with the Spirit, Peter denied Jesus times due to his fear of being arrested, but later on he was transformed by the power of the Spirit. Additionally, the Pharisees and Sadducees were amazed at the wisdom and knowledge that came out of Peter and John's mouths, because they were unlearned men. The Holy Spirit is our teacher in all things, and the infilling of the Spirit should be something that marks all believers. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit may be a one-time event, but the infilling of the Holy Spirit should be a regular occurrence in our lives. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 7, 2022."
