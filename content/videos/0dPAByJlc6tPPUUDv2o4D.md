description: "Jesus never told His disciples to sit around and wait for Him to return, yet so many of us have been living our lives like this has been said. We have been sucked into the rapture mentality, just accepting Jesus as our savior and quietly scurried on into a corner. We have been given dominion over the world and instead we called everything that has been contrary to our OWN belief have called it of the devil, unknowingly giving up all the dominion of things like music, fashion, media. We are now being raised up to restore back the dominion to His children. Our victory lies in the instructions of the Lord. We have been following the trends of the world for far too long, it is time for us to set the trends, to get to the Holy of Holies and continue to get instructions from the Lord. Only He can give us these ideas, invention and inspiration. He will provide all that we need, all the people we need, all the influence we need to flip this world upside down and point right back to Christ. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 19, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
