description: "This evening Pastor Cristina talks about the meaning of grace. Grace is defined as an unmerited favor or a gift we don't deserve. Grace is the love of God and love will never fail. We didn't make it into heaven by our own works, but by the blood of Jesus. We didn't earn the love, Jesus earned it for us. Jesus has to be front and center in everything we do. We have to focus on the grace and mercy of God.   We can't do things halfway or sloppy. We must do all tasks with excellence. Get excited and talk to God! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
