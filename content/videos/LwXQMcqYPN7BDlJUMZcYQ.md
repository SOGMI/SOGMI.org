description: "This training session focused on the prophet Jeremiah. He was a man who followed instructions to the letter. Take prophet Jeremiah as an example of how to do things God's way, despite the threats of death, he did not waver in his instructions. Yet when we are given instructions we often time focus in the positive without taking into account that instructions are included. The hard truth is, if you are given instructions and you do not follow them, you are acting in disbelief, therefore you are included in the group of the wicked. Whether the prophetic word you are given is bad or good you must obey God's instructions to release them. Our Father will always relent if His people repent and turn away from their wickedness. All these trials that we are facing can not all be taken from us, we are being trained and equipped for the transfer of wealth, influence and affluence. Keep in mind our Father will not let us bear more than we can handle. Remember God has our best interest in mind, He has chosen us to be the ones to open the doors to the transfer of wealth. Clean up all your unfinished businesses, turn away from the worlds ways, set your eyes on our Father and enjoy all the blessings coming our way. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Cristina Sosso."
