description: "Our world is no longer functioning on the world's way of doing things, Christ culture is on a rise and we have pushed back on all the corruption that we have allowed for to long. We have been running on the grace of God and we have been taking advantage of this. We have allowed ourselves to believe that since we are under grace we have the right to continue to sin. This is a lie that we have told ourselves. No longer we have already begun the healing process. The blindfold has been removed from the American people, we no longer can be fooled by the media. The grey area has been removed, we are no in a battle between good and evil, and we have already pulled ahead. God's people are beginning to replace the old and corrupted ways of doing things. new ideas, inventions, media, and ways of doing things Christ ways is on it's rise. So get excited, our battle has already been won, we are in a fixed battle. Our Father is still laughing on His throne. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 3, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
