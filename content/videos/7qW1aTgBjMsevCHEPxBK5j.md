description: "A power packed message this morning on the focus of the Kingdom, How we should be consistently seeking after the will of the Father and His kingdom. How do we spend our time daily, are we focusing on what we can gain for ourselves, or to better the Kingdom of God. Pastor Cristina reminded us that we should be holding ourselves apart from the world, to have a constant conversation with the Lord. In return our spirit will be able to pick up things in the spirit that we otherwise would not be able to pick up. Take some time to come back to this message to gather all the gems that have been given. this sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 13, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
