description: "It's time for the Body of Christ to realize that we are more powerful than we know. The obedience of just one person can change the course of a nation. Faith does not analyze. If you would just believe your instructions you will see your life turn around, your family turn around and even the nation turn around. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 3, 2021."
