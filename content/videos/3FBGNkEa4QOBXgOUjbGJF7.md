description: "The reason why God chose Joshua to be the next leader after Moses, was because Joshua got distracted by the presence of God. When Moses would go into the tent of meeting, the Bible says that Joshua would remain in the presence of God after Moses would leave. When you focus on God and His presence, He redirects you and causes you to expand your mindset. We need to get out of ourselves, and our desires, and start to think global! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 09, 2022."
