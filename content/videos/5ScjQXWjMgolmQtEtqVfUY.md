description: "Pastor Josh focuses on how our lives need to be subject to God's authority. In every area of our life, we need to consult God and ask him what is from him and what needs to be removed. We also need to apply God's authority to the way we do business. Like Pastor Josh said, in the future, there will be industries and ideas that we couldn't fathom today. We need to allow God to have his way in this world. God also has to guide us in being a leader because we can either bless or curse our followers by how we live our lives. We have to take this seriously and let God take authority of our life and there are no areas that are an exception. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
