description: "God is moving mightily in places that we may not even see and He is exposing things that were unknown to us. When He places His words in the mouth of His people, He empowers us to cut through anything and to play a part in His manifestation over our nation. The United States achieving its calling and destiny is dependent on the Body of Christ. So take on the attitude of Joshua and Caleb-- it doesn't matter how big the giants we face our, what matters is our faith and obedience. Change your mindset the thought pattern of a leader and when we obey, God will move the mountains! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
