As we move into it we must be mindful of the seeds we are sowing and how we can sow the right kinds of seeds. God is going to be dealing with the world including the arts and entertainment industry. The Body of Christ needs to be in position. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 10, 2021."
