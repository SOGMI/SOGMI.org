description: "Tonight's message focused on cleaning up our idols and man made distractions. God has passed the baton to the Body of Christ, and we must take hold of it. Our instructions are to tear down idols,  shrines, and anything that we have created to get in the way of Gods manifestations. We are to run God's race not looking to the left or the right and wondering what is going on around us but to look to the finish line for the victory. Activate your faith by the way you walk and talk, and by acting healed with your corresponding actions. Do not let your mouth be your own stumbling block. The eyes of the world are on you, so lead by example. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 13, 2022."
