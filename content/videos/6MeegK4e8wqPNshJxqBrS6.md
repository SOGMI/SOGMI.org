description: "This morning, Pastor Josh came to remind us of the prophecies that we heard during the Prophetic Gathering of the Saints. God brought us into a new kingdom in 2024 and we have to make sure we are using our authority properly. Pastor Josh gave a great example of how we handle authority at work. When your boss puts you in charge of a project, your scope of authority is only within that project. You are not allowed to use the finances on anything else. That mindset is exactly what we need when we get authority of God. He is giving you authority for a specific area, but you have to get direction and stick to the plan of God the whole time. We also need to be faithful servants with everything God has given us. If you don't like where you are, ask God how to be faithful to graduate from that position. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
