description: "Many Christians profess to love God but will continually disobey His commands. In John 14 Jesus said to His disciples, \"Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.\" So in disobeying the Lord they have proven that they do not love God. In fact, many Christians love themselves more than they love God, to where their selfishness leads to idolatry. In verse 31 He says, \"... so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.\" Jesus made Himself an example for the world to follow. In the same way, Christians need to be the model for the world to follow. That we love the Father and do exactly as Father tells us. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 28, 2022."
