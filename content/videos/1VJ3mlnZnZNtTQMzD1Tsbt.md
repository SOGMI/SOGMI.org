description: "Tonight was a night of Instructions, correction, and discipline. Dramatic changes are coming and are here al over the world. Last weeks instructions were given once again. Avoid delays. Our Father has told us that He will not allow any individual to pull down those who are doing His will and following His instructions. New opportunities are going to be given to those who have been following His instructions every week as long as we follow and complete every task He has given us by His timeline. For those who are straddling between two worlds, God is requiring us to pick a side, we are no longer allowed to be lukewarm believers. He will give us to the world. Our Father is all loving and forgiving, as long you do not give up, He will never give up on you. We are to be the light of the world and this country. Don't rejoice in the fall of the wicked, do not laugh at their failures, instead pray for there salvation and failure of plans. Keep a watch over your mouth, do not spread bad news, and do not say things you do not mean, you will be held to it. The line has been drawn, there is to be no more compromise. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 7, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
