description: "In this season the most important thing for us is to obey our instructions, and we must also avoid head knowledge at all cost. We can become a stumbling block for other Christians if we try to inject head knowledge into their situation. In II Chronicles 16 King Asa sought the help of the physicians first instead of God. Many Christians do this! They seek head knowledge first before God. In the same way, in Mark chapter 5 there was a woman with an issue of blood. In the Scripture it says, \"She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.\" It wasn't until she went to Jesus that she encountered her complete healing. In knowing this let us be slow to speak and slow to give our options, but let us be quick to listen to the Holy Spirit. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 10, 2021."
