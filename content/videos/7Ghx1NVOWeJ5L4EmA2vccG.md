description: "We, as Christians, must lay our own desires aside in order to fulfill the calling God has for us. God is looking for people who fully trust Him and have made themselves ready. In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, only those who were prepared were able to enter into God's plan. They had to have their oil ready, just like we must continually ask God to make us ready and be busy about His business. Remember, God is looking for someone that fully trusts and abides in Him. This means that when the pressure of the world is knocking on your door, you must stand firm in believing His word, even if you have to speak it over yourself. Let His word take root in your life, and you will be a part of this great move. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Mike Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
