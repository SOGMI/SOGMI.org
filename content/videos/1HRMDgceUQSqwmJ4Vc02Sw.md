description: "This evening Pastor Joshua gave a powerful message encouraging us to step out of our comfort zone, to check the motives of our hearts. Are we in this move of God for our own personal gain? Are we missing the point of this whole move because of our own wants? Isaiah 61:1 tells us that we are all anointed to proclaim his good news, to bring good news to the less fortunate, bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the enslaved. It is time to raise the bar for ourselves, we can no longer be comfortable coasting off the obedience of our ancestors who dedicated this land to our Lord God. When are focus is on manifesting the Kingdom of God all our desires will flow to us without us even realizing it. Remember as kings we have a responsibility to look after the kingdom we have been given. Will we be trusted with what has been given to us or would we just be wasting our Lords time? Anything less than our full submission is not worthy for God. Generations have been passed up because they grew content with what they have. They no longer sought after the Kingdom of God but only after their own gains. Its time for us to break out of that selfish mentality. This generation will not be passed up like previous generations. Lets make the necessary changes and ask the Holy Spirit for gradience to get this move rolling with great momentum.  This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 23, 2022.\n"
