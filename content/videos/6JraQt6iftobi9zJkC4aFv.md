description: "This evening Pastor Cristina gave a reality check for many of us about our prayer life, specifically the political parties. Mark 11:25 says \"And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.\" What does that say to us? Are we praying against these political leaders out of anger? Are we seeking for them to be punished for their wrong doings? If so, this is the reason why our prayers are not being answered is because we have not forgave them for their wrongs. along with our prayers hitting the wall, we also are not being forgiven for our own sins. Instead of condemning those who are sinning against Gods will, we should be praying for their souls to be saved, as well as praying that satan can not use them any longer.\nOur focus should be to never give up on our country, this will benefit the generations to come and ourselves. Matthew 21:21  Jesus replied, \"truly i tell you, if you have and do no doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, Go throw yourself into the sea, and it will be done.\" A very powerful scripture of faith. All things our Father could do if we just believe. Heads of states will be saved, lives will be saved, nations will be replaced with righteousness. Dwell in our Father's presence and you will be amazed how smart He will make us look, how anointed we will become, the lives we could change. Stay prayed up and enter his rest.\nThis sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Cristina Sosso on December 12, 2022"
