description: "Tonight, we thank God for the turning point in our nation. No one on the earth can get credit for the transfer of power; only God. Even when America was at its lowest point during the last few years, God did not let us fall. He knew that America would return to him and walk into its destiny. It is time for the church to step into the future God's has for us. We cannot assume anything anymore. We need to forget everything we have learned, whether good or bad, and be led by the Holy Spirit. Take hold of whatever vision God has given you and take it by force. Like Jacob in Genesis 30, God gave Jacob a vision of the spotted sheep and he took it seriously and ran with it. Pastor Cris has told us in the past to force the issue. Now that America is turning, it is time for our lives to turn. Spend time with the Holy Spirit and always come to him for the vision. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
