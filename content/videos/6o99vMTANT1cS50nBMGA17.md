description: "As it shows in Matthew 13, God sows good seed in the earth but Satan will try to buy his time by sowing his own seed, and he will try to take as many people with Him as possible. Some of these seeds have also weeded their ways into the Church in the form of doctrines that limit the move of God and his people. These doctrines are from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but the axe is already at the foot of the tree. We all have the potential to reach the fullness of God's calling in our life but whether we reach that is up to us. Start removing the false doctrines that are from the wrong tree in your life! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 05, 2021."
