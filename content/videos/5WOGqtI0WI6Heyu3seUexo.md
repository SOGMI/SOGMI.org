description: "We, as Christians, need to allow God to build our business and build our life. It's time for us to examine all of our plans and lay them down before God. We cannot be stubborn at this time. If you cannot be taught by the Holy Spirit, you won't get anywhere. God has given us these 40 days to get on track. Let's us prove to God that He can trust us! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 7, 2022.\n"
