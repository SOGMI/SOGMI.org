description: "When Jesus called the disciples saying, \"Come and follow me\" they left everything immediately to follow Him. They did this because they recognized this as an opportunity that is too good to pass up. This is what the calling of God is like for us. It's too good to pass up! God is going to force us to rethink how we do things. The disciples were fishermen. That's how they made their living, so you could say that they were experts. However, in Luke 5 they spent all night fishing the way that they knew and caught nothing. When Jesus told them in the morning to \"cast their nets on the other side\" they could've just ignore him, citing they experience and knowledge, but they didn't. They yielded to his instructions and ended up bring a larger haul than they ever imagined. This is what the transfer of wealth will be like. When we rely on God and follow his instructions we will experience a supernatural result. When we do things according to our own knowledge we will come up short. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 20, 2022.\n"
