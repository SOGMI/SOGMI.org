description: "We must maintain the fire that God has ignited in our lives so that we don't have to play catch up. Pastor Josh compares the flame of the Holy Spirit to creating a fire in the natural. Once we've started a fire, it's easier to keep it going and to burn more. Like the five virgins with trimmed lamps awaiting the bridegroom in the Book of Matthew, we must be ready for any directive of the Holy Spirit. Buffet your flesh so that the Spirit of God can move in you. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 21, 2021."
