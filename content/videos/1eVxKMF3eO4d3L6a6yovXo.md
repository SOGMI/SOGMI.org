description: "In this season, your effectiveness in the transfer of wealth will depend on how well you implemented the principles of the Kingdom and how well you yielded to the Holy Spirit. We need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit! No matter how good you think you are or how smart you think you are, if you're doing it in your own understanding then it's the world's way! It's time to get with God and get direction from Him. This sermon was delivered by Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 09, 2022."
