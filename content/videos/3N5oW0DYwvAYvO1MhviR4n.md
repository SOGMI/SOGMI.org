description: "In tonight's message, Pastor Josh gave a powerful message of being prepared for Gods move. Are we going to be ready for the manifestations or are we going to be left behind? Are we going to multiply our talents or squander our opportunity all together.  We've  been told time and time again that time is of the essence, so let us step into our God given positions, multiply our fruits and step into the full Glory of God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
