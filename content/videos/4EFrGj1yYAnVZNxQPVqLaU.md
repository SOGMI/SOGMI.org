description: "The Body of Christ needs to walk in the Supernatural, but in order to do that we need to mature. If you are still always asking for other to believe and pray on your behalf then you are not yet mature enough. Jesus when he preached He preached with authority and power and the people who amazed because of it. His authority came from the father God. When you operate you need to ask yourself did my authority come from God or from man? This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 30, 2021."
