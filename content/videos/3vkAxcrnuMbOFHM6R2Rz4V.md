description: "This morning Pastor Mike reminded us that we are ambassadors of our King. Our opinions have nothing to do with establishing God's kingdom. Every member of the body of Christ has a mission. If any part of a body does not function that body is in trouble. One of the main issues many believers\nstruggle with, is that we try to put God in a box. We like to think that our Father lives in our church, when in fact our Father is everywhere. He is not confined to a single building. Jesus did not come to establish a religion, he came to establish god's kingdom, and guess what? We are a vital part of that kingdom. We need to carry ourselves are representations of our God. We have been given great authority over the earth, along with an unstoppable weapon, the Holy Spirit. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church on February 12, 2023 by Pastor Mike Sosso"
