description: "Pastor Cris focuses on the fashion and design industry this morning and reflecting on the training that we had on Saturday. During the training, the youth followed the pattern they were given and kept going back to the teachers to make sure they were following instructions correctly. That is a good representation of how we should follow God. When we get instructions from God, we need to follow them to completion, then go back to God to make sure we are on the right path. For the Transfer of Wealth, God is going to give you the pattern that you need to follow. Your job is to follow instructions and continue to go back to God all the time. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
