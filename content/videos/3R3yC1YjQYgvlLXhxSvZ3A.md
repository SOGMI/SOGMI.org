description: "God is expecting His Church to become holy as He is Holy (I Peter 1:16). We are called to be set apart from the world's system and even our own ways of doing things. You can get on track with that by seeking God out and learning from the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can be your teacher in everything, and once you experience Him anything the world tries to offer you will pale in comparison. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 04, 2021."
