description: "Are you a doer? Too many Christians are just talkers, complaining, giving opinions, or preaching at each other. The kingdom of God needs actions, a whole lot of talking can get us in trouble. You'll become a stumbling block for those who want to hear from the Lord. The time for actions is now! Your actions should speak louder than your words. Examine your heart when you feel the need to speak your mind, what is you motive behind it. These small heart issues need to be examined before you are placed into a position of authority. It's important to know that not every voice you hear is from the Lord, some may even sound good and spiritual, but the motive of the voice is wrong, you need to ask the Lord, with the Litmus test. Ask yourself while you are going about your day to day what is the will of the Lord? Many of us do not the opposite, we are only concerned with what you feel or imagine God's will is going to be. Let your actions speak the hand of God over your life, there is no need to try to boast yourself up, when God can do that for you. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 12, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso.\n"
