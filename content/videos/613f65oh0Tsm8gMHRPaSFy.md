description: "In order to live and walk according to the Spirit it's important to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and allowing Him to heal you. The disciples were able to speak in tongues and be understood in various different languages. There's no telling how the Holy Spirit will be able to use you when you are lead by Him. In addition it's time for us to obey God so He infill us again and again. It's time for the Body of Christ to move supernaturally in power! This sermon was delivered by Ed Grubb & Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 19, 2021."
