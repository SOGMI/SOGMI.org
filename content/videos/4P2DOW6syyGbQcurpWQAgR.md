description: "The type of people we need in the Church this season are those who recognize the opportunities that God has given us this season. We must be like Jacob who recognized God's golden opportunity when he wrestled with Him and would not let go until God blessed Him. We must make ourselves sensitive to the Holy Spirit by integrating Him into our daily life so that we can recognize His opportunities. Be tenacious and be excited because our degree of obedience will determine whether we get a permanent or temporary victory. Actively search for God's best so we can be like Jesus who was always in the right place at the right time. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on June 13, 2021."
