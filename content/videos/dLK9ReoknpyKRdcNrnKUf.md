description: "All three persons were present at the creation of the world. They made a unanimous decision to create mankind in their image. Genesis 1:26-27 (NKJV) \"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...' So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\" The three persons of the Trinity did the same thing when they called you. They made a unanimous decision that you were set apart for your calling to move in power. Knowing this, fear and doubt should completely disappear from the Body of Christ. Our identity is in Him! We must also learn to become one in Christ and in doing so we also become one with the Father! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 13, 2022.\n"
