description: "This evening Pastor Joshua Sosso discusses how we are in a spiritual warfare for this nation. We can't wait for the election to fix things and no single politician can fix the mess, but only God. How can God bring judgment to the wicked, when we are wicked as well? The only way we will be spared is by being covered by the blood of Christ. We can't take people at their words, but by their fruits. If we aren't willing to put God above everything, then we aren't worthy of the calling. Just as Abraham gave his son Isaac to God, we need to have complete trust in God. The things we surrender, he will give us greater in return. What are you gonna do with the opportunities that God has given you? God put us on this earth to be a blessing to others. If you don't know where to start, focus on him and think about how you can serve him better. He will take you to higher things. This message was given on April 24th, 2024 at Freedom Fellowship Church international.\n"
