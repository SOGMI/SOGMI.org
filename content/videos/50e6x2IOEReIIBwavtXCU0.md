description: "When Jesus came he was the second Adam and He made up for the mistakes of the first Adam and redeemed us back to God. So now we have been brought back as if we are before the fall - before sin, and not only that He has offered us eternal life. So it is written: \"'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.\" I Corinthians 15:45 (NIV) This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 09, 2021."
