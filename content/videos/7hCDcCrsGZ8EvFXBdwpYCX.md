description: "This evening Pastor Josh focused on the story of Adam and Eve and how God's intentions are far better than what we know. When God created Eve, she was made from Adam and was meant to be one again in marriage. Despite other teachings, God didn't make Eve less than Adam. They were intended to be one in Christ. God also gave Adam authority over the Garden of Eden, but even though Adam was in charge, he still tasked with taking care of the garden. Adam had to learn how to care for all the plants and animals under his care. We have to take that same mindset in whatever area God has assigned us to. We have to be taught by the Holy Spirit in the spiritual realm before we can take over in the nature. But once we are promoted in the place of authority, we have to continue working the ground. Lastly, when the serpent deceived Eve, she was tricked to thinking God was withholding knowledge from her. God was looking out for their spirit and always had their best intention. Even though we might think we are missing out on experiences in the world, we have to know and trust that God is looking out for us and the bigger picture. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
