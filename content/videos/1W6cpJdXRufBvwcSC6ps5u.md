description: "It's time for Christians to get rid of their opinions and learn to rely on God. God's word is fresh and new every morning. Our opinions pale in comparison. Our reliance must be on God alone. Once you fall in love with God you will appreciate Jesus more and you will be willing to set aside everything to follow and obey Him. The greater works are coming. Prepare your heart and your mindset to step into it. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 09, 2021."
