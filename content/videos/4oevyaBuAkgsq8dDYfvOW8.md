description: "We must surrender our own way of doing things and commit to be led by the Holy Spirit. Those who act according to the flesh will not inherit the Kingdom of God. God is preparing a mighty move in the earth. We must get in position through our faith and our obedience. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 11, 2020."
