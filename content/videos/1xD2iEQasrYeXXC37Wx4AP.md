description: "God wants to bring about new things in the Earth. If what you are doing or trying to do has been done before then it is an old way of doing things. Forget about your own opinions forget about your own ideas. Instead focus on what God is saying, and He will reveal secret things to you. Isaiah 48:6, â€œFrom now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to you.\" and remember, God will share His glory with anyone. He will surely manifest His will in the United States of America. So stop trying to make yourself look good and focusing on your own ideas and opions. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 2, 2021."
