description: "Many Christians will receive a prophecy and instruction from God, but then will add to the instructions things that they want to do under the camouflage of obedience and spirituality. Without knowing it when you do this you are delaying your own manifestations. We have to learn to not assume anything and to submit to God above all else. God cannot take you to your promise land if you keep inserting your own things. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on May 12, 2021."
