description: "Like the parting of the Red Sea, the Israelites had to trust in the Word of God that he was going to part the water, even when he did it at the last minute. God is expecting the same kind of obedience from us. It shouldn't matter the circumstances that we are facing, all that should matter is that God is the one that spoke the word and we will follow it. Pastor Josh reminded us not to let our thoughts or circumstances be the reason that we don't pursue God's word. This sermon was delivered on August 18th, 2021 at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
