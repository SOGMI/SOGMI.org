description: "This Evening, Pastor Josh touches on the story of David. David received a vision from God but he didn't follow what God said down to the letter. Which led to the vision being postponed and passed down to Solomon. As for us today, we can reflect and learn from this story. We need to listen to the vision of God COMPLETELY. There can't be any deviation from his word or the Transfer of Wealth will be postponed. once the vision has manifested you must continue to seek God constantly for the next steps he has. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Joshua Sosso  "
