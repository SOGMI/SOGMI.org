description: "Things are going to start manifest this month of July. If you have not followed the instructions God has given you and gotten in position you will find yourself playing catch up. The transfer of wealth will come suddenly when you don't expect it. We must focus on God. Don't allow yourself to be distraction by doctrines of fear mongering regarding the end times. We must focus on God. As long as you are breathing as still alive on this earth you need to run towards God and pursue Him."
