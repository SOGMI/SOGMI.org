description: "Our Father has called us together for a very important message. This will be our __last warning__. \nDue to our latest victory, some of us have taken it upon ourselves to gloat at those who opposed us. We have not been following the directions of our Father. We have not been humble, instead we have been wishing for their downfall. Prayer, forgiveness and salvation is what they need, not a kick while they are down. Pursue the perfect will of God, that all men may be saved. Remember Jesus pay for it all, because of His grace we are now all given the right to be children of God. Lawlessness has never been tolerated by our Father, so why do some of the members of the church support it, pertaining to the illegal immigrants in the country? God has given us this victories not for our benefit, but for His. He will get all the glory. We have to continue to pray for those who oppose us and pray for our country so that we can continue the work of our Father, to bring as many as we can to the Kingdom of God. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 10, 2024 by pastor Cristina Sosso.\n"
