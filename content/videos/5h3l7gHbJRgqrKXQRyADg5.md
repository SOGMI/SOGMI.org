description: "Today we celebrated the answered prayers that are happening in the United States. Even though we have seen breakthrough, there are many other miracles we are going to see in the world. Pastor Cris reminds us that during this time, we cannot do anything without hearing from God. We have to have a constant communication with God so that we can hear from him on every area of our lives. She also says to remove any expectations you have from God and allow him to move however he wants. The best way in our lives is what God has planned for us, not what we expect. Like Pastor Cris said, we have been doing our own thing for years now and seen no results, so we should fully commit to God and try his plan. What do you have to lose?"
