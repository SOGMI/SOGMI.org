description: "During this message Pastor Cris addresses the importance of obeying the Lord. In Psalms 81 the Lord says how if Israel would only listen to Him he would bless them immensely. However he said, \"But no, my people wouldnâ€™t listen. Israel did not want me around. So I let them follow their own stubborn desires, living according to their own ideas.\" This is what is happening in the Church today. Many Christians are refusing to listen to God so they are being turned over to live according to their own ideas and desires. Pastor Cris also addresses how Prophets must focus on the heart of God. Those prophets who have the heart of God will intercede on behalf of others, especially when judgement has been prophesied. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 24, 2024."
