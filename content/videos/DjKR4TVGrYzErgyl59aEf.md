description: "This morning, Pastor Joshua talked about authority in Christ and how in Christ anyone can be appointed into power. There are teachings in the Church that indicate that women cannot be in power based on the scripture from 1 Timothy 2. However, we need to look at the whole context of the book and acknowledge that Paul was speaking to the church of Ephesus. God did not make that decree, but it was Paul trying to create some order in the church. Everyone is called by God for a specific purpose that only God knows. We cannot pick and chose people in our own knowledge because God has his own plan. We need to treat everyone with an equal opportunity just as God treated us. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
