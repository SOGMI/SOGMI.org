description: "Pastor Josh continued on the idea from this morning about reexamining every area of our lives and line it up with God's plan. Pastor Josh adds on that we need to build every area on solid foundations. In the Bible, there were people who built up on the rock and the sand. The houses built on sand were wiped away, while the house built on rock stood for ages. Success is determined by your foundation built on God. If you have businesses or projects that aren't founded on God's principles, then you are working in vain. So, examine every area of your life and see what work you are doing in vain. When you go to God and get his direction, he will save you time and headaches.\n"
