description: "This morning's service focused on following the instructions given to us by our Father. We have to give the Holy Spirit liberty over our lives. The most important thing for this transfer is to make sure that the Lord is with us in all our endeavors. Remember it only took one man to change the world of Egypt in Genesis, a man named Joseph. If Joseph saved a nation and helped make pharaoh rich, how much greater will we? After all Jesus said we are going to do far greater than him if we only believe and follow Gods commands. (John 14:12) Keep in mind none of this will manifest if we do not remove our mindset of selfishness. What are the reasons for all our prayers? Is it to gain things for ourselves? Do we believe its what we deserve? This type of thinking will put a blockade between us and our transfer of wealth. Our daily bread is our daily instructions to follow. It is the Pattern that our Father gave us to follow. To walk out our prayers, believing that when we say Amen, it is done. We are all qualified, and have the opportunity to step into this transfer of wealth, but it is up to each and everyone of us to to obey. So will you follow God's pattern? This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
