description: "In Joshua chapter 11 it states how Joshua obeyed every single instruction that God had given to Moses. We must do the same in every area of our life and we will see the move of God the likes of which has never been seen before. We are in spiritual warfare at an individual level and at a national level, but we are the ones who will emerge victorious if we trust and obey God. Focus on God and His instructions. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso with some closing words by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 21, 2020."
