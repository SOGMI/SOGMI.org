description: "God is waiting on his Church to be ready! Many Christians wonder, \"Why hasn't God dealt with the wicked?\" \"Why hasn't the transfer of wealth manifested in my life?\" The reason why, is because the Church is not ready. Too many Christians are immature and are focused on themselves, and because of this they cannot step into leadership. To tackle this, Pastor Cris addresses the things we need to do to prepare for the move of God. One thing that she explains, is that we need to measure our day by the seeds we have sown not by what we received. Every day, we should be looking to sow seeds into other peoples' lives and into our nation. You can do this by praying for the nation, praying for the healing of others, and praying for others to be blessed. We also need to be engaged in spiritual warfare. God is counting on us to be faithful with the opportunities he has given us. If we do that, we will surely be a part of this mighty move of God. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 5, 2022."
