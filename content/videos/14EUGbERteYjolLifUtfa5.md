description: "This evening Pastor Joshua gave the urgency of following the instructions that God has given us. Whenever we put ourselves before God's move, we allow time for the enemy to make his moves. Many pastors are working under the doctrines of men. In this way, they are viewing their congregations as sheep, which is insulting because sheep can not survive on their own with out human intervention. This causes the church to look to their pastors for guidance instead of our Holy Father. This was the reason Jesus left, if he would have stayed behind, his disciples would have looked to him for every decision. The stakes of the world are at risk, God has given us dominion over the earth, so every corruption, and disgusting thing that is happening right now all over the world is due to the church's lack of obedience. Time is short but God's move is quick if we just buckle down and push towards God's move. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International"
