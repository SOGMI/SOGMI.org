description: "Just as Jesus taught us that the Kingdom of God is like a treasure that a man learned of and sold all his possessions for, we must look upon the opportunities God is giving us as something of great value. In Matthew 19, the rich young man couldn't see that the value of becoming a disciple of Jesus was so much more valuable than everything he was giving up. We must be willing to look past our immediate needs, desires, and wants to see beyond to where God wants to lead us. Pastor Josh encourages us to declare that \"God, where you want to take me is better than where I want to take myself.\" Obey God with passion, excitement and fervor and let us see where He takes us this week! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 4, 2021.\n"
