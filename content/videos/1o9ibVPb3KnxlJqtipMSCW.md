description: "God is accelerating the healing of the United States and we play a great role in this move! Pastor Josh discusses ideologies described by Yuri Bezmenov and how the symptoms of this ideology can be seen in current events. This does not have to happen on our watch. It is up to the Body of Christ to stay vigilant and in sync with God because He can uproot, heal and restore. Sovereignity, power and greatness is our inheritance through God. Included below are videos Pastor Joshua referenced during his message. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 20, 2020.\n\nVideo 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQPsKvG6WMI\nVideo 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OtFprM3No"
