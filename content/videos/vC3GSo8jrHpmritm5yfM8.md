description: "This morning Pastor Cristina has shaken things up by not only giving us a miracle service but also a training on healing. You will learn that everyone is can be used by God. It is His will that all men and women be healed and nothing can separate us from His love, not even our sin. Our enemies are not to be excluded from our prayers, in fact we are told to pray for them. Healing has nothing to with you and your anointing, but that it is God's will. We just need to believe the authority that Christ has given us through His death, burial and resurrections. Once you know your authority in Christ, you will not need to call anyone else to produce healing. Do not preach something that your are not walking yourself. If you harbor any unforgiveness towards an individual you should not pray or receive from them. The Holy Spirit will get you to the root of the problems, not all infirmities are due to spirits, some are unforgiveness, bitterness, and assignments. Lead with discernment. A powerful message and teaching, lets get excited for this move. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 9, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
