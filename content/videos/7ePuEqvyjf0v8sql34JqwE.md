description: "We had the privilege of Deborah Ferrel sharing with us this evening the idea of becoming what God called us to be. Like she mentions, all of God's promises and the gifts he has promised us are within the Bible. God has destined you for greatness and the best way to get to where God wants us is to grow our relationship with him. Deborah shares an example of how God called her to be a teacher. While she never thought she would become a teacher, she learned to enjoy teaching because that was God's plan for her. You might wonder why God calls you to a specific industry, he has the perfect plan for your life and you will even enjoy what he has for you."
