description: "It says in Hebrews 12:26-27,  “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.” 27 The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.\" This is what God is doing in this season. God will shake every realm of influence so that only those things that are unshakable will remain. We are on the precipice of the transfer of wealth and influence. To prepare, we must make sure our schedule revolves around God, not our own plans. We must strive to go before God so that we do not rely on our own understanding. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on 11/27/2022.\n"
