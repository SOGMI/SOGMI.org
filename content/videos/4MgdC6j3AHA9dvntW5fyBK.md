description: "We had the treat of hearing from Ed and Sylvia Grubb on two different topics the Lord gave them. Sylvia discussed how the Lord healed her when she grew very ill and placed his hand upon her. Ed discussed the importance of hearing and obeying the voice of God through personal experiences. Those little instructions from the Lord are our training grounds. Let us prove to God that we can be faithful in these little things, so that he will entrust us with greater missions. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n\nHere is a list of the healing scriptures Sylvia referenced:\nExodus 15:26; 23:25-26\nDeuteronomy 7:14-15; 30:19-20\nPsalm 91:9-10, 14-16; 103:1-5; 107:17, 19-21; 118:17\nProverbs 4:20-24\nIsaiah 41:10; 53:4-5\nJeremiah 17:14; 30:17\nMatthew 8:2-3, 16-17; 15:30-31; 18:18-19; 21:21-22\nMark 11:22-24\nLuke 6:19; 9:2\nActs 10:38"
