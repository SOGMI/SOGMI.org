description: "This evenings service focused on solely being lead by the Holy Spirit. Peter when thrown into jail for doing the will of our Father. He was able to be freed by an angel of the Lord because he was lead by the Holy Spirit. This goes to show each of us that when we are being lead by the Spirit , there is no situations that we will not be able to be saved from. In fact anywhere God sends us is the safest place to be. Pastor Joshua also talks about how we should pray. When we are praying we should be asking God what to pray for, and to give us understanding. After we are given these instructions we should not pray with our own understanding, assuming you know what God is gonna do. Remember we have been chosen by the Holy Spirit to bring heaven down, despite our qualifications. Rely on our Father always. Its time to be productive and fruitful. This sermon was delivered on December 4, 2022 at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Joshua Sosso. "
