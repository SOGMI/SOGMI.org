description: "A reminder this morning that the instructions we have been given by our Father in heaven is not a suggestion, but a mandate. We are too mature of Christ followers to pick and choose to what and when we obey our Father. The things of yesterday is already in the past, so leave it there. This is the year for us to change the usual way we carry our lives. The prophets have spoken for change, and it will stand. Supernatural changes are coming and our Father will not be pleased if we turn back now knowing what we have been told to do. Our Father knows when we are moving out of the flesh or just going through the motions, when we are obeying God because we are looking for the personal gain and not because we want what's best for the nations. He looks at the Heart. Are we willing and obedient? each and everyone of us have been chosen for a greater purpose and many of us know what purposes those are, so will obey and continue to obey for what's best for our nation or will we postpone our time further. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 15, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
