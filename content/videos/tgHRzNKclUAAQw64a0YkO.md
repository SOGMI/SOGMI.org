description: "As we follow and obey God we have to remain teachable. For Christians this is easy in our weaknesses. We often quote \"In my weakness He is strong\", but more importantly than our weaknesses we must also submit our strengths to God. Those are often the things that people will not listen to God, because they \"already know\" how to do it."
