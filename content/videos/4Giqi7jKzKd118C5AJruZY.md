description: "In Isaiah 46:10, God says through the prophet Isaiah, \"I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, 'My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.'\" When Pastor Cris in prayer concerning the nations, this is what the Lord spoke to her \"My purpose will stand\". God has already spoken what He will manifest in this nation. Those Words will surely come to pass. We as the Body of Christ need to prepare ourselves. Anything that needs to be put in order should be put in order, because when the move of God comes we will not have time to catch up. Additionally Pastor Cristina reiterates instructions that we pray over the United States, especially over the course of the next few weeks. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 19, 2022."
