description: "In Exodus, the Tabernacle was built according to the pattern and vision that the Lord gave to Moses. This is the model that we are supposed to follow in every area of our life including the Transfer of Wealth, Influence, and Affluence. This is explained in Acts 7:44 where it says, \"Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.\" Even Jesus followed the vision and instructions from God. In John 5:19-20 Jesus said, \"Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.\" So if this is the way Jesus walked then we must follow in His ways. We cannot do it by our own power or understanding. The vision must come from God. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 26, 2023."
