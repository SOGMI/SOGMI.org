description: "This evening, Pastor Josh focused on how God is preparing us for the destiny God has for us. This is a make or break time and God is not going to delay any longer. He mentions the prophecy in Isaiah 46 that God is ready to move now! Pastor Josh also spends time in 2 Kings about the passing the torch from Elijah to Elisha. Elisha would not leave Elijah because he was hungry to follow God. Elisha had the mindset that he wanted to further and higher than Elijah did. That's the same mindset we need in this day. We need to be determined to achieve greater than the generation before us, because we have the chance to be apart of a great move in history! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
