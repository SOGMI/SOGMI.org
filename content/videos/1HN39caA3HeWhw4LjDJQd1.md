description: "Pastor Josh discusses how the Lord declared He would purge away the dross and impurities in Isaiah 1. After that He would restore the judges as in the days of old and Israel would be called a City of Righteousness, the Faithful City. This is a word for our time as well! Stay resolute and keep your heart before the Lord. He is doing a great thing in the earth! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 18, 2020."
