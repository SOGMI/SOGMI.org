description: "We had to privilege of hearing Deborah Ferrel. The Holy Spirit gave her the connection that the founding fathers incorporated Christ's birth in our government and the United States was created to fulfill the Great Commission. She also discusses the idea of two farmers who were told they would be receiving an abundant crop. One farmer believed and praise God for the manifestation, while the other farmer when out and prepared his field and was ready for the manifestation. Which farmer do you think got the blessing? We must get busy in believing what God has spoken over us, because faith without action is dead. We have so many things to correct and now is the time to do it. Put your faith to your faith and walk in the promises God has given you."
