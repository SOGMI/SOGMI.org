description: "Pastor Cris shared a powerful message that started with the perfect will of God for our lives. In order to have the perfect will in our lives, we have to develop a personal relationship with God. Like a marriage, a perfect relationship isn't made by demands, but by listening and talking to the other person. Pastor Cris closes with the idea of the monuments we have in our lives. She references the book of Samuel, when different kings wanted monuments set up in their honor. She challenges us to look for the monuments in our live so we can eliminate them and focus solely on God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
