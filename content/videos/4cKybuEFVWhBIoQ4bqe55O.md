description: "Have we been faithful in the instructions that we have been given? Have we became the mocking and complaining Christians that we see everyday. We must remember that we are to be the light in this world. To move with love and not act as if we are holier than thou. We have been told we are the time clock of God, that means that we are the ones that cause delays. God moves when the body of Christ is in agreement. Our focus and our goal is to make disciples of all mean, of all nations. All these nations, meaning entertainment, politics, countries ect. succeeding has been touched by the Body of Christ. This is the time to be preparing for the great move of God. The time is now. We don't know the time or season that the Father will make His move, but we sure do not want to be unprepared for it. If you don't know what you need to be doing, you need to fast and pray for instructions. The last thing we want is to be ill prepared for the move, because we will be left out. We are not students of the word of God, but students of Christ. Always remember when you hunger for God, He will show up. \"Because you have showed up for me, I will show up for you.\""
