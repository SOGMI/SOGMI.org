description: "How much time are we spending with the Holy Spirit? For many of us, not very much. Soon it will begin to backfire on us. Now is not the time for us to be going with the flow, being lazy, or just straight up disobedient. This is a time of manifestation, but if the body of Christ has not been productive, what do you think is being produced? For those of us who have been believing and receiving a healing, continue to walk, talk, and act healed. For too long we have been fasting and praying when we are in trouble, this has been incorrect. Fasting and prayer is for preparation for the battle to come not for the battle that you are in already. Let us all play our part in the Kingdom Of God, let us not fade into the background and let the world continue on its path. This will be the season and time that we all take our stand and push back against the enemies of darkness. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 27, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
