description: "We do not have time to waste in this season. God is moving quickly and we need to get into position. During this sermon Pastor Cris outlines the qualifications that God is looking for in people who will be a part of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence. Remember God doesn't qualify according to the worlds ways of doing things. We operate according to a different system. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 06, 2021."
