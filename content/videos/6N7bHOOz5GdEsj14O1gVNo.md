description: "The seed get's sown on many types of soil and if the soil isn't good then it will not prosper and multiply. We must allow the word to grow and prosper and we must value that which God has given us. We can do this through faith, obedience, and discipline. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 07, 2020."
