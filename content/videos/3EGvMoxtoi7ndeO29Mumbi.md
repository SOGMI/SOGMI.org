description: "Pastor Joshua Sosso reminds us about a prophecy we received before the first inauguration of President Trump. When the solar eclipse was seen across America, Pastor Cris prophesied that America would go through a period of intense darkness, but it would only last for a short period. We must focus on God's promises because the evil cannot sleep unless they have devised evil plans. We see this in the Book of Esther when Haman's plots against Mordecai and the Jews are reversed so God's people remained unscathed. We know why God sits in the Heavens and laughs! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 10, 2021."
