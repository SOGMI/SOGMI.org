description: "We don't know how God is going to do things. It is so important that we hear from God every day about what we should do. We must also watch our words because if we focus on the negative things then it will diminish your faith in God. Focus on God. Focus on His ways of doing things. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August, 2, 2020."
