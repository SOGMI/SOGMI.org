description: "Our victory and blessing are directly linked to our love relationship with God. God is more than willing to manifest blessings and manifestations for us. So we need to ask why are there delays? It has to be something involving us. Many Christians are self focused. Let us focus on loving on God and romancing Him. It is His love that enables us to love others and become a blessing to others. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 14, 2021."
