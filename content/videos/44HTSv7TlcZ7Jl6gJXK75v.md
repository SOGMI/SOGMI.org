description: "In this season, we have to learn to comply to the leading of the Lord. It is not time to complain, but to comply. In the same way, it is not a time for us to observe, but it is time to take action on the things that God has given us. Focus on what God has given and don't fall into covetousness. Many Christians will fall into covetousness when they see another person's calling and try to take it over. In doing this they become a stumbling block for other Christians while abandoning the post that God gave them. Focus on the instructions God has given you! You have to believe that God is able to manifest what he promised in your life. Those prophetic words that God has spoken over you. They are the light shining in the dark places - pointing the way that we ought to go. Focus on those and step forward in obedience! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 17, 2021."
