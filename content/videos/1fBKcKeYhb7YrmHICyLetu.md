description: "God has been preparing his Church for governance His way. Because of this Paula addresses the importance of governance of the heart. If God is to entrust us with influence we must first exercise proper governance over our heart. This means when we have thoughts that are outside of God's ways of doing things we must take them captive. When we begin murmuring and complaining we must exercise governance and submit to the will of God. This sermon was delivered by Paula Nations at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 17, 2024."
