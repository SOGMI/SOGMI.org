description: "Our personal relationship with Jesus is the most important relationship we could have. Just as it is when we're in love, when we look for opportunities to spend time with the person we're interested in, our relationship with God should mimic this to a great extent. As we fall in love with Jesus and pursue Him, we will become more like Him. And as we get closer to Jesus and begin implementing His ways of doing things, we will bear more fruit. Examine your ways of doing things that you've been applying to whatever area you have not been fruitful in, and get connected to the vine. We will see abundance, fullness of joy, and the transfer of influence as we abide in the vine. Make it a goal to declare every morning, \"God, show me what I need to do today to serve and honor you. Yank me into the position I need to be today.\" The joy we find in Christ is far greater than anything we'll find in this world! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 30, 2021."
