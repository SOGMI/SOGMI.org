description: "We must be in place and set aside time to hear from God and pray for our country. We are all being prepared to be kings and priests, not one or the other. Take care of unfinished business and put pressure on ourselves to begin tackling instructions, obeying God and thinking like a leader. Think about the destiny that God has for you and how you will start implementing with Him. Our faith and obedience will change the course of history and we will be a generation defining, history moving people. Run your race as best you can, as far as you can and as hard as you can. Let us not forget God's promises! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 11, 2021. \n"
