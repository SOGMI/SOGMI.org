description: "Service began with a brief reminder of the Three major feast of the year. The Passover, Pentecost, and end of year feast. The Passover celebrates Jesus as the Passover lamb. Pentecost celebrates the year of the harvest and coming of the Holy Spirit. The end of year feast celebrates the ending of the year and the welcoming of the new year. All these celebrations revolve around our savior Christ. Pastor Cristina followed with having Fear of the Lord and not fear of anything else. Fear of the Lord is not a worldly type of fear, it is a fear of reverence. As a Christ follower you can not allow yourself to give into any other type of fear. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of self worth etc.. All these fears are ungodly and demonic. Our Father has not given us a spirit of fear. You shouldn't even allow word of fear to even leave your mouth. Words like 'I don't want to miss out.\" Instead it should be \"I will not miss out.\" You don't fear God because you have to but because you love Him, because you don't want to hurt Him, because you want to please Him. He is the best Parent we can ever have, so wh not try to make Him pride. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 17, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso.\n"
