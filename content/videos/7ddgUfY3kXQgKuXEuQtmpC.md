description: "When God called you to leadership (as a tycoon, financier, CEO, etc.), He didn't do it so that you would make a name for yourself. It was so that you would be a blessing and establish God's ways of doing things in that arena. We need to put pressure on ourselves to take responsibility over the place that God has put you in. Focus on the mission instead of trying to get your ministry established. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 23, 2021."
