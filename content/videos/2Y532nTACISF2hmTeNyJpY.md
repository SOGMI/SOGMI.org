description: "Goliath relied on his size, his strength, and the size of the Philistine army, but he was slain by David who put his trust in God. We need to forsake our strengths and what we are good at and learn to rely on God. It's time to start celebrating because God already said that the battle is won! A major shift is coming and the move of God will truly come to pass in the earth. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 08, 2021."
