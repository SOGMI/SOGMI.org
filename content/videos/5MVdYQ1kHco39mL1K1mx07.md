description: "We as the Body of Christ need to rely on the Holy Spirit instead of our own wisdom. Things are happening quickly in the spiritual realm, and God has already decreed and declared that the United States of America will enter it's finest hour. So because of that we thank God for a righteous government instead of complaining about the wickedness! God is moving and has been making Freedom Fellowship Church ready for it! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 22, 2021."
