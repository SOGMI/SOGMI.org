description: "You cannot walk and move in power if you do not have a lifestyle of praying and asking God what to pray. Pastor Cris recounts a story of how God directed her to hold a praise rally. When she obeyed God used that simple obedience to drive a satanic organization out of Texas permanently. There is power in prayer and obedience. As it says in I Peter 3:12 \"or the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 15, 2021."
