description: "How can you go wrong if you're taking all your decisions to the Lord? To put all your trust in the Father. It doesn't matter who you are or what your status is, God can quickly take you from the lowly position and place you above many, if you just obey the instructions he has given you. Do not allow the positions you have been placed in to be neglected, in all that you do, you do for the glory of the Lord. Remember our perception of what God is doing is so small compared to His plan. Many of our assumptions of what God's plans are for this nation are wrong. God knows the best plan for us and has his perfect timing. Trust God's plan for your life and this nation. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX. "
