description: "Happy Resurrection Sunday! We spent the evening praising God for everything he's done and doing in our lives. Pastor Josh echoed what was shared this morning; it's time to break away! God said the battle is ours, all we have to do is go collect the plunder. Believe that in ever area of your life and say \"I'm going to break away\". This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
