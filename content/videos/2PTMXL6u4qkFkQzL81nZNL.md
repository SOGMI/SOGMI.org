description: "For the Transfer of Wealth, Influence, and Affluence God is going to give us direction, timing, and confirmation. First and foremost, it needs to come from God. In I Samuel 10 Saul didn't ask for a sign, God gave him a sign, and then He gave him a series of very specific instructions. This is how God intends to direct us concerning the Transfer of Wealth. So, it's time for us to lay aside our own understanding and seek after God's ways of doing things. When we do that not only will we be blessed, but we will also avoid a lot of heartaches and troubles. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 19, 2022."
