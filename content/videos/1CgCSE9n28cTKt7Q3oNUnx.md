description: "When Joshua was appointed as leader he had to change his mindset. Before, he was a servant and follower of Moses. All Joshua had to do was to obey what Moses said. Moses had all the responsibility to make the major decisions. Now as leader, Joshua had to make decisions that would affect the whole nation. Part of our instructions for this season is to start thinking bigger. God wants to put His Church in authority so we have to start thinking outside of ourselves. We need to starting thinking global, and we need to transition our mindset from that of a consumer to a producer. Time is of the essence in this season. We need to obey God in every area. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 05, 2021.\n"
