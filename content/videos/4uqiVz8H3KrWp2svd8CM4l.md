description: "This is the season where the apostles and prophets are beginning to emerge and take the center stage. As a result of that, the Church will grow in maturity and be put into it's proper order. God's move is coming to America and the media, the politicians, the tech companies, and Hollywood won't be able to stop it. When they try to exert their authority it will shrivel up in an instant. The only way that the move of God gets postponed is if His body starts to release unbelief. This is also a season of acceleration. God's Word is mighty! So it's time to get excited! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 29, 2021."
