description: "Today is the season of manifestations concerning the transfer of wealth influence and affluence. We can't wait around for the right opportunity to obey God. Matthew 11:12 tells us that the violent take the Kingdom of God \"by force\". We need to be forceful in our obedience to God. We cannot delay any longer. Manifestations are today. Manifestations are now. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 2, 2022."
