description: "This evening, Pastor Josh discusses how we need to have faith in God like Abraham. We cannot only rely on God in hard times, but when things are going great. In order to answer the call, we have to be all in.  We must deny our wants and desires daily.  God can't bless us until we completely surrender to him. We need to trust God with everything. He has our best interest at heart. Faith requires us to stand up against the giants. If we can understand and rationalize some idea, it isn't in faith. We will be forced to take a step and follow God. It's time for the Body of Christ to step into maturity. This Sermon was spoken at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
