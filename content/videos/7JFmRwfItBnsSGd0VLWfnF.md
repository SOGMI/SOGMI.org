description: "Through our obedience to God, we make the world like heaven. As it says in Psalm 126, \"When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like the ones who dreamed... Then it was said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them.\" We need to look beyond ourselves and our immediate desires to see the glorious future that God has in store for us. Our prayers, our faith, and our obedience are powerful, so we need to put our faith and obedience in action so the heart of this nations will be transformed. Cast aside idols and get rid of anything that becomes a priority before God as it says in Ezekiel 20:7. Start to refocus your vision, realign your desires and ask God on a daily basis to make you want what He wants and to make you fall in love with Him again. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 22, 2021."
