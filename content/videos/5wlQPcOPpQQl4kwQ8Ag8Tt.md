description: "This evening, Pastor Mike spoke a powerful message about our identity in Christ and how that will lead to his plans for our life. Since our identity is in Christ, we are part of God's government we have the power to bind and loose here on earth and in Heaven. However, we also have to apply the implementation into our lives as well. If our identity is in Christ, we have to lay everything down at his feet and reset our daily life. This is a constant battle that we have to fight. But we have to remember, this is God's battle not ours. Continue to focus on him and move forward towards the implementation in your life. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
