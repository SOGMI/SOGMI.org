description: "The Transfer of Wealth is so close to manifesting, and God is going to give us new ideas and concepts, but we have to protect the vision that God gives us. Like Pastor Cris mentioned last week, she allowed other people to derail the vision that was given to her. Pastor Mike reminds us to keep those visions holy and not let anyone come between our calling. He also shows us that following our calling not only helps us, but helps build up the church as well. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
