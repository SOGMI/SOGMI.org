description: "This evening was another power packed message instructing us to keep listening and obeying, the word of God. We are not like every other nation, we are unique. Be patient, and keep your eyes focused on our Father, He knows what he has promised you and He will not go back on his word. Just like David who was sent to the battle field on an errand to bring his brothers food, he did not go seeking his destiny but simply stepped into it by obeying. Some of us are worried that we are not good enough, that is okay, because if we were perfect we would be taking glory away from our Father. Our short comings keep us in the pursuit of perfection, always trying to improve ourselves. The most important thing is to ask our Father for instructions daily and have the Holy Spirit work on our hearts. If you are concerned about all these \"nations\" that seem to be rising up, don't,  our Father has already given them over to Jesus, and just like Jesus we will rule and reign this \"nations\" starting this year. This is a year of uprooting, explosions and God's great move, we should all be grateful that we are apart of this great move. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship  Church International on March 08, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso.\n"
