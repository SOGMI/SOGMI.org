description: "Pastor Josh shares with us the list of miracles God has given to him over the years. He urges us to find a way to remind ourselves of the promises God has given to us. Like the Israelites, we do forget of the miracles God has given to us from time to time. During thanksgiving, take time to think of all the miracles God has provided for you."
