description: "We had the pleasure of hearing the teachings from Ed Grubb and Javier Solis. Javier shared with us about having godly love. In the book of John, Jesus continued to ask Peter if Peter loved him. Peter only loved Jesus as a brother, not with godly love. His heart wasn't ready for the godly love we have to have for the Lord to use us. Ed discussed the characteristics of God's servant and how we can use those to grow our relationship with God. As a servant for God, we are all specialized to have different strengths. We each have our own specific works and are made to help each other. Ed even gave us ten characteristics for us to follow, so we suggest tune in to learn them! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
