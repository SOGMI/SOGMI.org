description: "We must learn to differentiate between doing good and doing God's will because we aren't living in terms of doing good or doing bad-- we must start thinking in terms of God's best versus just good. One of the greatest stumbling blocks in the Body of Christ is presumptuousness, like Saul who offered the burnt offering before Samuel could arrive, but we must submit  all areas of our life, personal ventures and business ventures to God. Don't assume what God is going to do, ask Him directly. Treat God as holy and revere Him and His instructions. What we do when nobody is looking will determine our success in the Kingdom of God so get rid of your own mind and take up the mind of Christ!"
