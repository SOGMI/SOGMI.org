description: "Changes are happening fast! We needed to be willing to yield to God changing and rearranging things. Sometimes God is going to tell you to do something that you are uncomfortable with. If you aren't willing to step out in faith (even if it's embarrassing) then you will not be able to discover the many facets of God and how He can use you. Also knowing these things, we have to remember to keep true to the pattern that God sets out for us. In Exodus God gave Moses an exact plan and pattern for creating the tabernacle. This pattern came straight from heaven. The same is for you when God gives you a vision. You have to remember not to change any of it because it came straight from heaven. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 14, 2021."
