description: "Pastor Josh shares with us prophetic words that the Lord shared with Pastor Cris that the darkness will only last for a short while. He goes on to share the store of Mordecai and Esther in the book of Esther. Mordecai was working when God was positioned to hear an assassination plot against King Xerxes. God used that moment to protect Mordecai when Haman was planning to kill him. God also positioned Esther as the King's wife to tell the King of Haman's plans. However, Esther and Mordecai had to decide in their hearts to do the right thing, even if it was standing up to the King. Like the book of Esther, there was a wicked government oppressing God's people. But God was thinking two steps ahead to position his generals. God is doing the same thing now, so don't pray out of fear, because God will have the last laugh. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
