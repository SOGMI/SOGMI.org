description: "This morning, Pastor Josh talks about the importance of prophecy for the church. Prophecy always points back to God and his master plan in our lives. Like in the prophecies about Jesus' birth, the prophecies affected the whole world and guided people for the future of the world. Pastor Josh also mentions that seeds are always working, even when you can't see them. Just because we don't see them spouting out of the ground, the roots are still growing in the ground. Finally, we are told to stop building up our own name in the world. Our focus needs to be on God and he will raise up our name in the background. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
