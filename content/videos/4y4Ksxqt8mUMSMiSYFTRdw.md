description: "In II Kings 5, Naaman approach Elisha with pride thinking he would be treated as special, but Elisha didn't even receive him. Instead he sent him a message saying, \"cleanse yourself in the Jordan River\". Because of this, Naaman went away angry saying, \"I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldnâ€™t I wash in them and be cleansed?\" Eventually Naaman was healed after humbled himself and obeyed. However it was his pride and his expectations that delayed his healing. For many Christians these same issues are what is causing them problems. They approach the things of God with expectations that they have built up in their head. We must cleanse ourselves of our assumptions and humbly seek God out. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 15, 2023.\n"
