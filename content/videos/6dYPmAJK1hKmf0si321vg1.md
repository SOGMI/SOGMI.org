description: "In the world, there is a lot of turmoil and there are many upheavals, but the Lord has instructed us not to be afraid. Before entering the promised land, God instructed Joshua to not fear but to be strong and courageous, because the Lord would be with them. Courage was necessary, because they were going to face a lot of opposition. It is the same for the calling of God upon our life. There will be challenges. There will be oppositions, but we should not fear because God will be with us and He will show himself strong. II Chronicles 15:7 (NIV) says, \"But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded.\" In the same way, the disciples were also afraid when they saw Jesus walking on the water, but Jesus said to them, \"Take courage! It is I. Donâ€™t be afraid.\" See? They didn't even recognize Jesus coming towards them because of their fear. Sometimes we do not recognize the Lord's move because it is covered with challenges. So take courage and never give up. We should continue to press on trusting in God. Don't focus on the obstacles. Focus on Jesus! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 8, 2022."
