description: "In today's message, Pastor Cris talked about the receiving of true repentance and how our usual apologies aren't sufficient enough without corresponding action. In order to reach true repentance, we have to completely abolish sin without turning back. She also talks about the repercussions of sinning against God and how it affects generations. She brings up the story of David and how his sin of adultery hurt his linage and ultimately his legacy. Pastor Cris ends by urging us to have a passion for sharing the gospel to others so that it is second nature to share what God has done for us. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church in San Antonio, TX."
