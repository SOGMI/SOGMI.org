description: "Pastor Michael Sosso explains how we need to be living by the spirit in all things. It says in James 1:5, \"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.\" This is especially important in this season because those in the Body of Christ who lean on their own understanding will find themselves in enmity against God. Afterwards Pastor Cristina Sosso talks about how God is able to move us from impossible to reality. So it's time for the Body of Christ to take responsibility and get right with God so He can use us mightily. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 09, 2021.\n"
