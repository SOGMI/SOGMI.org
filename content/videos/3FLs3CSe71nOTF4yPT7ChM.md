description: "Deborah shared with us a great message about the expansion that the Lord wants to give us. But with the increase and expansion, we have to step out of our comfort zone. She gives examples that walking by faith is uncomfortable. We have to learn to walk by faith in the supernatural, so we have to get uncomfortable to see manifestation. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International. "
