description: "Our every day should be supernatural! Pastor Josh shares how the Elijah experienced in the supernatural even in the midst of the famine. In this time, we must pursue obeying God no matter what because He is leading us into a decade that will look very different from what we see now. God is calling Christians into every industry that will bring about a complete transformation to nations and generations to come. Wherever God is sending you, you will find your oasis and the provision from God. Become more God-focused and less self-focused. The vision that God has for us, you, and the world, is far greater than anything you could imagine for yourself. So start implementing! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 31, 2021."
