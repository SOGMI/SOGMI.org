description: "When David was just a shepherd Goliath was his golden opportunity. In the same way, we need to see our challenges and weaknesses as opportunities. Christians will many times turn down opportunities down that God opens for them because they think, \"Oh that's not my calling.\" \"God hasn't called me to do that.\" Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you even into things you don't understand. If you do that then God will train you into becoming a king wherever He sends you. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
