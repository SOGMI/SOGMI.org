description: "When God expands our tents it causes us to step out in faith, just like Peter stepping of the boat onto the sea, which went against everything He had known until then. The move of God goes beyond our understanding and our expectations. We must learn to trust God and obey Him completely with this because He always equips us wherever He sends us. Allow God to cause us to step out into something unknown and He will equip us every step of the way. Our qualifications are not what God is looking at because our faith and obedience to Him is our qualification. When you succeed, God's name is made great through you. So get ready to step out onto the waters! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 07, 2021."
