description: "Pastor Cristina Sosso continues to focus on training the Church to step into a position of leadership. God is going to raise up a generation of leaders who will defy everything except to obey God. To count ourselves as among those leaders we need to obey God with gladness in our hearts. It may seem hard on your flesh but when you are in love with Jesus it's easier to trust and obey Him. So focus on loving on God! At the same time we have to remember that we no longer operate under the Law. We are not Levites; we operate under the order of Melchizedek. If a teaching limits you, limits others, or limits the move of God then it is from the Levitical priesthood. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
