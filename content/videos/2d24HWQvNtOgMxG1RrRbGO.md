description: "All of creation is waiting in eager expectation for the manifestation of the sons of God. Who are the sons of God? Romans 8:14 says, \"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God these are the sons of God.\" So it is anyone who is led by the Holy Spirit. If you are doing that then you are a son of God. With this, we can now understand that the land will produce abundance in places where the people allow the Holy Spirit to lead. In your own life, you will find abundance and prosperity where you allow the Holy Spirit to lead. In the same way, those people that will be a part of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence, those people will be sons of God. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 30, 2021. "
