description: "In Jeremiah 9:23-24 it says, \"Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches, but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me...\" Our own abilities, and our own ways of doing things are insignificant. It's time to focus on loving God and seeking to know Him more. This is a new season of blessings and manifestations! With that in mind when challenges come in your life, keep your joy! God has already determined the end so trust in Him and enjoy the journey He takes you on.\n"
