description: "Pastor Josh continues the sermon from this morning by stressing that time is of the essence for the Transfer of Wealth to manifest. He reminds us that when we are looking for a breakthrough in an area of our life, we need to sow seeds into other people's lives. If we need a breakthrough for our business, then we can pray for manifestations for other businesses. Pastor Josh spends time heavily in Exodus 34 and how God made a covenant with Israel. Like with Israel, their obedience affected nations and generations. Our obedience today can affect the course of history for generations. Spend time with God and put him first during these next 40 days to see your life changed forever. "
