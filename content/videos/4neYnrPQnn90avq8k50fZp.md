description: "Our actions prove our faith and God has said that He has answered our prayers. So this week is about thanking God for His manifestations because He has done it. Remove the things weighing us down, our own desires, time and way of doing things. Everything we give to God, He gives us so much more back. Be willing to submit to God because this week we're expecting miracles, signs and wonders.\nSubmit Yourself to God is a sermon delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso on March 28th, 2021 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
