description: "Pastor Josh continued on speak towards the arts and entertainment and how we can succeed by the leading of the Holy Spirit. He mentioned that the current media portrayed that following God isn't fun, which is false. It is our job to tell stories that will captivate people that are similar to the parables that Jesus spoke in. He also talks about how the Lord wants us to shift our mindset from a consumer to a producer.\n"
