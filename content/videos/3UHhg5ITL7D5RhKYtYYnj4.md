description: "This is the season of Rosh Hashanah which means \"the head of the year\". God has stated that this is a season of new beginnings and healing. It's time that we finish ALL of our unfinished instructions and tasks so that we can be partakers in the blessing God has for us. This seromon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 20, 2020."
