description: "This evening, Pastor Cristina focused on the impact we will have on the world. Our prayers can stop crises and change hearts. In 1 Kings, God was going to disaster upon Ahab, but Ahab changed his heart and fasted to change God's mind. When God saw this, He allowed the disaster to hit in his life time. Pastor Cris even talks about a recent time when she prophesied for the sun to shine brighter during the cold. We have to remember that it only takes one to make a difference. But we have to stop spreading bad news and have to be willing and obedient. Time is of the essence. We cannot afford to not hear from God in this time. Spend time hearing from God and getting ready for the awesome things he is going to do in 2023. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX. "
