description: "We often look towards people or information to find solutions to our everyday problems. Pastor Josh reminded us that rather than using other options to solve our problems, we should have God as our number one source. The Holy Spirit can teach us anything and it doesn't matter how long you have been in the word. All that matters is that God sees the faith and obedience inside your heart. Focus on God and new ideas and inspirations will come forth. This sermon was delivered on July 28th, 2021 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
