description: "We have been freed from the law through Jesus Christ. Religiosity perverts the ways of God. When Jesus healed on the Sabbath all the Pharisees and Sadducees could focus on was that He chose to do it on the Sabbath rather than how the lives of those healed were transformed. We have to allow the Holy Spirit to lead us especially as He prepares us to step into influence and affluence. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 7, 2021."
