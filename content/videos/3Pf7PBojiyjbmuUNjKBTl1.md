description: "This evening, we were blessed to have a Prophetic School before the end of 2023. Ed Grubb shared with us how faith plays a big part in prophecies. Faith requires a total sacrifice of our heart and mind to bring forth prophecies. Like in John 11, Jesus was looking for faith to believe that Lazarus could be brought back to life. Pastor Mike focused on obedience to allow prophecies to work. In Acts 2, there were people of every kind that obeyed the Lord and there were all filled with the Holy Spirit and understanding each other. We need to obey the instructions that we have received from the Lord so we can see God move. God can use each and every one of us, but we need the faith and obedience to be used mightily by God. This service was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
