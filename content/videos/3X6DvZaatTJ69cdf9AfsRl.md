description: "Pastor Josh starts off reviewing the sermon from this past Sunday that we need to change our ways and remove the past sins in our life. Like in the book of Isaiah, some Christians honor God with their lips, but their hearts are far from him. We cannot be that way in this current time. If God gives us these industries where we are right now, we will contaminate them and make them worse. So, we need to make a decision in our heart to pursue God during this time, even if it's inconvenient. We are at a turning point in the Transfer of Wealth and it's our decision if we are going to make radical changes to get right with God in our life. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
