description: "If we as Christians do not waiver and continue to have faith in God then God will manifest His mighty power - even in the coming weeks. If you cannot celebrate God for His promises now, then you will not take part in the manifestations. Unbelief is a stench that wearies the Lord. We must stand in faith and obedience to God now more than ever. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso and Pastor Cristina Sosso on December 12, 2020 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
