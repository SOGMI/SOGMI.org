description: "The things happening in the world, across various industries, are not happening because a judgement from God. Isaiah 24:5 states, \"The earth suffers for the sins of its people, for they have twisted God's instructions, violated his laws, and broken his everlasting covenant.\" (NLT). Because of this, we must pursue God with full abandon.\n\nThis sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 12, 2019."
