description: "When God called both Saul and David they did not see themselves as something great, however God's plan for them was much greater. When God anointed Saul through Samuel the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him and he was suddenly able to command the armies of Israel. He also made sure to give glory and honor to God in everything he did. However He became comfortable in His position and thus stopped listening to the direction of God. When David was called by the Lord the Spirit of the Lord also came powerfully upon him and he was able to do many mighty works. However the difference between Saul and David was that David developed a relationship with God. He wrote many songs of worship and adoration to God. Saul did not do this. Instead Saul relied heavily on the words of the prophet (which he sometimes obeyed and sometimes did not obey.) Pastor Cris also address the Philippine Church concerning the current political situation following the 2022 Philippine election. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 11, 2022.\n"
