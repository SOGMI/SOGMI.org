description: "This mornings focused on ridding ourselves of the yeast of the Pharisees. Waking up every morning with the new mindset to walk with Christ and follow His every instructions. Put your eyes on Christ and focus on what He has going on for us and not all those around us that are focusing on the fall of man. Our Father is so great that whenever we reach an accomplishment, discovery, or blessing, God has a greater purpose in mind not only for you but others. Your true inspiration lies in the presence of the Father. His discipline is always out of love, if you're not being corrected, you probably should be worried. We should all be excited, because our Father is on the move because we are on the move with Him. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 3, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
