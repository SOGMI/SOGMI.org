description: "Pastor Cris shares with us that God is preparing us for our ministry. With the Transfer of Wealth, God is placing us in the areas that we are going to carry out his will. We have to look at our place in the Transfer of Wealth is going to affect future generations. We have to forget what we've learned and allow God to take full control his promises. With whatever God has given you, allow God to expound on the ideas and plans without your opinions. It doesn't matter who you are or where you've been. Manifestations will come by your faith and obedience to God. "
