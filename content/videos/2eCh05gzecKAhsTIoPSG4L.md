description: "This morning Pastor Mike focused on the spiritual authority, and how to get to that point in our lives. In this time we will no longer be a self centered body or individuals. It is time for us to surrender our lives to the complete guidance of God. How often do we go throughout our daily lives believing that we are crushing it! Only to realize that we have not taken anytime out for our Father? This year will be different. When we surrender our lives to Christ way of thinking, we will realize that all the stress of trying to organize our daily routine melts away, because our Father will be the one to organize our day. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church on January 29, 2023 by Pastor Mike Sosso."
