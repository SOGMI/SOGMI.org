description: "In Genesis the ark that Noah built was a boat build upon the instructions of the Lord. It's purpose was to protect Noah and his family and to create a new beginning, but it was only possible because Noah submitted to God and followed His instructions to the letter. The young generation in the Church needs to focus on the God and learn from the mistakes of the past generations. If you submit to God and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you He will give you wisdom and understand straight from heaven, and it will be far advanced compared to anything in the world. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 25, 2021."
