description: "Many in the Body of Christ selfishly focus on their own desires and wants. Think about it. How many hours of prayer have you spent on yourself? First and foremost we need to focus on God and the task He has ahead for you and He will take care of that which concerns you. It's time we become people of purpose and destiny. We are going to have to make an account for every idle word and every missed opportunity. If you were to face God today would you be proud of the race you ran, or would you be filled with regret at the opportunities that you missed. Let's make God proud starting today! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 22, 2021."
