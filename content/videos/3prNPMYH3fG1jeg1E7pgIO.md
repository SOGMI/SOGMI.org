description: "We had the privilege and honor to hear from Nicole about being called for such a time as this. She reminded us of an example from American history where problem solving in the natural couldn't help.  Back in American history, our founding fathers were trying to write the constitution, but were struggling due to disagreements. Once Benjamin Franklin convinced everyone to go their separate ways and pray, they reconvened and wrote the document faster than they imagined. This story applies to us today since we have tried our own way of doing things for years. Like Pastor Cris shared last Sunday, we should turn to God and try his way of doing things, since his way cuts the time drastically. Plus, his ideas are better than anything that we could imagine. "
