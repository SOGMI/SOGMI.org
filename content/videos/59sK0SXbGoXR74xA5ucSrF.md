description: "Pastor Josh continued the message from this morning about getting rid of the monuments of your life. Sometimes getting rid of some of the idols can be uncomfortable. Like Pastor Josh mentions, the people that God calls in the Bible were faced with uncomfortable situations all the time. They were always facing impossible odds in the natural. A good example was Samuel who had to address an elder like Eli for his actions. When you are able to overcome your uncomfortable situations, you will see blessings in your life. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
