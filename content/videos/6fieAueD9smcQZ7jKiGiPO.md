description: "This sermon focuses on the prophetic and what it takes to be a prophet. Pastor Cris reminds us to know what our focus is on. If it is always on the negative, we have work to do. We have to remember to have Jesus at the front and center of our focus. She also reminds us that time is of the essence to obey the instructions and prophecies. The atmosphere is changing and signs and wonders are coming. "
