description: "This evening Pastor Joshua talks about how the instructions that God tells us might not always make sense but we must still obey. Just because something is good, doesn't mean that God wants you to do it. The Lord has to give us our orders everyday. God has created each of us to do a specific purpose, so we cannot be envious of one another. God is appointing and anointing new leaders across the world, including us. We should take our disciples higher and greater than we ever did, just like Jesus did for us. Take us higher Lord! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.  \n"
