description: "This morning Pastor Cristina began with the qualifications of the transfer of wealth and influence. Beginning with removing our mindset out of the poverty mentality, because if we don't start with that we can not partake in the transfer of wealth.  We must value the time and opportunities that we are given, treating each others possessions and the worlds businesses with respect as if it was our own. Be prepared for hardship and push back while you try to advance in your lives and businesses, there will be competition and the worlds way of doing things will try to tear you down. Only if you are walking with faith and being lead by the Holy spirit will your endeavors prosper and expand. Jealousy has no place in a believers business, it will destroy relationships, businesses, and ministries. If you have the \"poor me\" mentality you will also disqualify yourself of the transfer of wealth. You are an adult so make the proper changes for your offspring. Your flesh desires addressed in Galatians 5:19-21 will also disqualify you. So lets obey and follow the teaching and leading of our God, choose a man or woman after Gods own heart, who are just excited to be a part of Gods move and we will be all set for the transfer of wealth and influence"
