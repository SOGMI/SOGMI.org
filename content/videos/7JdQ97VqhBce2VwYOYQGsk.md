description: "In this sermon Pastor Cris Sosso explains four that we need to implement in our life. The first is that we need to focus on the Words of the Lord concerning your life and the transfer of wealth ,influence and affluence. The second thing is that we need to enlarge our vision concerning the transfer of wealth. As it says in Isaiah 54:2, \"Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes.\" The third instruction is to always thank God and always be grateful. The fourth instruction is to operate under the new covenant, and most of all, what God needs from us, is complete obedience to His leading. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 07, 2021."
