description: "We had a powerful sermon from both Nicole Mendoza and Deborah Ferrel. Nicole focused on our identity in Christ and taking the time to know God. Like in a romantic relationship, we take our time to get to know someone before we trust them and they trust us. The same goes for our relationship with God, we have to know him completely for him to trust us. Deborah talked to us about being confident in what God says. If the Bible says that you were healed when Jesus was on the cross, you have to stand on that word. No matter what the outside world is saying in your circumstance, you have to trust that God's word trumps the natural. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
