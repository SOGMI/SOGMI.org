description: "We had the pleasure of hearing a double sermon from Nicole and James. Nicole touched on the transfer of wealth and how Moses was to be courageous because he was led by God. Just like Moses, we are to be led by God to see the manifestation of the promises given to us. James spoke on the Parable of the Sower and how seeds fell on different types of soil. Based on the instruction that God has given us, we should take them and sow them in good soil consistently and not following the ways of the world. "
