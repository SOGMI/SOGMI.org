description: "Time is ticking, and many of us have been dipping our foot into two worlds, man's and God's. God will not be able to use you if you are living in two worlds. He will not wait on you to decide, others will take your place. Many of us lack the discipline to follow the instructions that have been given to us. Remember God's word never fails Luke 1:37. If he has given you a word you can take that word to the bank. You must allow your life to revolve around God. Let your schedule, habits and mindset be changed by the Lord. Once the manifestations of the Lord have happened in your life, do not allow yourself to believe that you have arrived, that everything that you have accomplished has been done by your own hands. Never forget who brought you to your position. We have been called to be over nations and with a mindset of \"i did this by my hands\" you will do more damage than good. You can not build anything that God has given us by ourselves, it is bigger and more astounding than we can ever comprehend. "
