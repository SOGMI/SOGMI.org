description: "Pastor Joshua teaches about Abraham and the set of instructions that come with His blessing. God is doing everything He can to prepare us to rule so allow the Holy Spirit to train you to become someone who can manage. God desires to give us influence and power so that we can shift the nation and the culture back to Him. Our only limitation is lack of faith or lack of obedience. Are we willing to sacrifice our greatest desire to Him as Abraham did? When Abraham was willing, He received His son back and so much more. Abraham knew God's heart and anything that we give God or meet God with, He'll meet it back and more. Be willing to be like Abraham so we can blaze a trail to run further. Trust God with every aspect of your life and learn to start implementing this every day. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 06, 2021."
