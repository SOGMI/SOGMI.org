description: "This evening we continued last weeks Sunday morning's message. Will we be ready for our Father's return? So many of us have been invited to His kingdom but time and time again our own personal lives take precedence over God. This is a time where the bare minimum will not do anymore, we need to give over and beyond to our Father. View our Father as not only our savior but our Lord. Our Lord has given us instructions here on earth, are we keeping to his commands or are we squandering the time we are given? Will we be blind sighted by our Father's arrival? When we get to heavens gate or Judgement will we be presentable for God's \"Banquet\"? God's mercy is vast and he will delay His time, but nonetheless His will will be done. We should already be viewing ourselves as leaders and able to disciple others. What else does our Lord deserve other than our obedience  and crowns to lay at his feet? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 1, 2023 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
