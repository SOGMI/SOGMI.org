description: "Tonight, Pastor Josh focuses on being set apart to be used by God. God cannot use us if we try to take the glory from him. He has to trust us that we glory him through the manifestations we receive. We have to be holy in every area of our life and walk in the ways of God. Pastor Josh mentions when Jesus headed for the cross and how he allowed God's will to be done. God asked Jesus to give his life for us. God is asking us to spend more time from him and make a few simple changes in our lives. The best way we can repay God for everything he's done for us is to obey every word and live the life he intended for us. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
