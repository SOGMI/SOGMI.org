description: "Tonight, Pastor Cristina Sosso talks about how angels will actively work as in the Bible once our hearts and minds are ready. So, you might wonder we don't see angels today is because we will be distracted by them and try to get recognition from people. Angels will never take glory away from God and neither should we. She also mentions how we need to look at things Globally. The destiny that God has planned for us will affect nations, so we need to prepare ourselves for it. We have an advantage in spiritual warfare since God is on our side. This sermon was spoken by Pastor Cristina Sosso on October 12, 2022, at Freedom Fellowship Church in San Antonio Texas."
