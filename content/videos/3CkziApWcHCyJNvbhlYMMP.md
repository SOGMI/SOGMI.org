description: "In preparation for the Transfer of Wealth Influence and Affluence Christians must learn to stop focusing on themselves. When Solomon asked God for wisdom he did so because he was concerned about his ability to govern the nation. Solomon wasn't focused on himself, he was focused on God's people. This is the reason God was pleased with Solomon's request. For most Christians, the majority of their prayer time is focused on themselves and what they want, but this will not be the case for those who will be at the forefront of the Transfer of Wealth, Influence, and Affluence. If you want to be a part of this move of God you have to stop focusing on yourself and learn to enter God's rest. Pastor Cris explains how entering God's rest means getting away from doing the usual things that you've been doing and what you want to do and getting into the things of God. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 31, 2022."
