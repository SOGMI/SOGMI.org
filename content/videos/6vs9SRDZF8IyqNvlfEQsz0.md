description: "Pastor Josh echoed the message that Pastor Cris shared this morning. The Lord is moving the hearts of kings and the Body of Christ is rising up to authority. He talks about the seven plagues in Egypt and how God always spared the Israelites during each plague, while the Egyptians suffered. Since God is separating us from the world, while the judgment is coming on the world, God will raise us up and we will continue to prosper. Focus on God's promises rather than the circumstances. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
