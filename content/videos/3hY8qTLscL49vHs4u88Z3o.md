description: "Pastor Cristina recounts how throughout her life God has supernaturally provided for her. We have to remember that the Holy Spirit isn't limited by anyone or anything. He can provide and protect better than anyone else can. She also discusses how in preparation for the Transfer of Wealth, Influence, and Affluence, that we need to model everything after God's ways of doing things instead of the world. This includes how we celebrate things and entertain ourselves. We need to be led of the Holy Spirit. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 8, 2022.\n"
