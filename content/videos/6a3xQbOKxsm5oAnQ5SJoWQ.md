description: "It's time for Christians to ask themselves: \"How many people were inspired by the way I lived?\" and \"How many people have been impacted by my teachings?\". The Body of Christ needs to mature in our relationship with God, and His workings must be evident in our lives. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 19, 2020."
