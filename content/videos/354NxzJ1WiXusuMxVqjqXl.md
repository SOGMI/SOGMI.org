description: "This evening we took a look into 2 Kings 9:1-24 and 10:17-31. The great work of Jehu, after given a prophecy of being king and removing all the wickedness of baal. He quickly went into action, bringing the too corrupt kings of Judah and Jezreel to be killed. He then gathered all the servants of baal into one area under deception. All who attended were put to death. The example of Jehu tells us that God could use unperfect men and women to move along his kingdom. It also shows us how quickly God could change the tide in an instant. He could use non-believers just as he could believers. We need to line up our words with what God is saying instead of what we are seeing. All these wicked nations (media, political parties ect.) could just as quickly come crumping down as it did in 2 Kings. It is important that we never doubt our Father ability to make a swift change, He has made it clear that it is not a difficult feat. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church.  "
