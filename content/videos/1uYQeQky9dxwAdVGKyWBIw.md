description: "When you allow God, He can take old traditions and change them. For example, Jesus transformed the Passover from being only about the Israelites being freed from Egypt and made it about being freed from sin and death. God can also bring forth new traditions and new ways of doing things if you are submitted to Him. It's so important to make Jesus our Lord and Savior especially in this season of acceleration and manifestations. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 26, 2021."
