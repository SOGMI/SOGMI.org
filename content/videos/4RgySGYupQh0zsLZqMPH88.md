description: "Pastor Michael Sosso discusses the necessity of being the presence of God. In this season we were given a set of instructions to focus on before the year's end. The first of these is to \"Get in and stay in the presence of God\". Our prayer should be like that of Moses in Exodus 33:15, \"If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.\" That's where the power is, and that's where the manifestations are. We were also given another instruction which is to focus on sowing seeds every day. We should be looking for opportunities to sow seeds that are beneficial to the Kingdom wherever we go. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 29, 2021.\n"
