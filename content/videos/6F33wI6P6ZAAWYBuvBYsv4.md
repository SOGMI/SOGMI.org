description: "What has God put under your authority? What industry have you been placed in? Where ever you have been placed God is requiring you to make changes in that area. You have been placed in that industry for training. Do you know how to make those changes? Ask the Father. Go into your prayer closet and ask the Father what you need to do. It needs to be a consistent prayer and questioning the Lord. The more time you spend talking the Father the easier it will be to hear Him in your day to day life. Your prayer should be in alignment with the Holy Spirit and will of God. Never forget that our most powerful weapon we have been given is our prayer. Be persistent with your prayer life, ask many questions if you do not understand and the Holy spirit will show you. This type of prayer life will allow you to make the changes that God wants in that industry, He will make you look so smart and it will bless you greatly. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 14, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso"
