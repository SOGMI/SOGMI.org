description: "We have all been tasked with becoming more like Jesus, to study the way Jesus carried Himself. Something that we will always have to deal with within ourselves is discipline. We are going to challenged to constantly keep our flesh in check, if we want to be effective in our walk. If we are not keeping ourselves in check now when we do not have anything, what makes you think you will when you have authority over others. Many believers have issues with other ministries because of different views on scriptures or ways of doing things, in the end we are all serving the same God, so we need to steer clear of competition among ministries.\nThis sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 12, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
