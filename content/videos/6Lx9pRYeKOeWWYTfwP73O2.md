description: "This evening Pastor Joshua spoke of the importance and power that come out our mouths.\nThe power of our words could be fruitful for the kingdom of God or it could be disrespectful to God's sovereignty. The truth is that giving our own opinions is counter active to Gods created order. \nBe an example for God, let others look to you and wonder how you have been so blessed. Let them know it could only be done by following God's instructions. Will we be able to raise and give God the glory or will we still give our own opinions? The body being raised up will show Gods sovereignty.\nWhen the Lord tells us that something is holy and sovereign, we need to treat it as such. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
