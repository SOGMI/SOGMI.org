description: "In Joshua 3:5, the Lord said \"Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.\" Consecration is a precursor to the blessing the Lord will pour out on the Body of Christ. Pastor Josh shares a continuation of the morning message and encourages the Church to repent for the areas that were discussed (abortion, human trafficking, pornography, spousal and child abuse, adultery, not honor their word, and spiritual leaders not practicing their own preaching). After repenting for these things corporately, we learned about breakthroughs in our nation that were shared during this message. God will not allow His people to be a scorn to the nations. Continue covering our nation in prayer and seeking instructions from the Lord! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 06, 2020."
