description: "Following the 2022 midterm elections God said to Pastor Cristina Sosso the following, \"I have been saying time and time again, I am a Holy God and I will not share my glory. No political leader or political party will be able to take credit for move of God in this nation, and the people will be amazed.\" We have to remember that God doesn't move according to our expectations and understanding. Additionally it says in Proverbs 24:17-18, \"Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice, or the Lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from them.\" Many in the Body of Christ have engaged in divisiveness and mocking concerning the political leaders in this nation. Our hearts have to be pure before God. Now more than ever we need to be wary of heart issues so that God can truly move in this nation. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 9, 2022."
