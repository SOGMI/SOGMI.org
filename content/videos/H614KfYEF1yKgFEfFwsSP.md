description: "We were blessed to hear a great word from Pastor Josh to really get to the calling of what God has for you. It doesn't matter where you are or what you've done, because God can meet you there. Look at Abram and Sarah, who lied to the king and God honored and prospered them. But we have to get into the will of God for our life, because we might be limiting what he can do. No matter what we do in our lives, it will crumble if it's not based in the will of God. Don't allow yourself to be limited by man made doctrines. We need to forget all of those and be led by the instructions of the Lord. We need to have an encounter with God so great that we will never turn back. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
