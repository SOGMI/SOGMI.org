description: "Our God is a good God. Though some have missed to train to God's move, He has reminded us that there is always another train coming to pick us up. Will we obey this time or continue to allow ourselves to get distracted again? He will not postpone His move on account of our selfishness, our love of money, and status. We need to distance ourselves from those Christians who allow themselves to react to what the see happening all around them. Be spiritually smart in these times and have an ear to hear to the instructions given. The Lord has told us this morning, \"Keep trusting and obeying me, and do not let another day go by without following instructions.\" Sometimes we get too caught up in religion that it causes us to forget who God is. He is a God of impossible. God knows all your gifts, even the ones that you have forgotten yourself. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 25, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
