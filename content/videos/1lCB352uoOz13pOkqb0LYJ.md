description: "Anything that we plan to do for ourselves is secondary to God's plans. Everything that we do must be God breathed. When Jesus was tempted, He was tempted with physical need, the temptation of pride, and the temptation of desire. He is our example and He showed us that He surrendered completely to Father God to overcome these temptations. What we have in Christ Jesus is far greater than anything we could be offered or tempted with. Our relationship with God should be about everything that we've gained, not what we've sacrificed, because nothing on earth can compare to the hidden riches that God gives us. Hold tightly to the vision and instructions God has given you. We have so much to look forward to in this season! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 26, 2021.\n"
