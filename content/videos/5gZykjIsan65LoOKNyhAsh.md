description: "Are we being consistent and persistent, with the instructions that the Lord has given us? Look around at the state of our nation. We are responsible for all the corruption that has been happening all around us. We as a church have dropped the ball. We are in a constant war zone with the world system, we have no time to get comfortable. Our time needs to be spent with the Lord, asking for instructions, pushing for change through prayer, and when you come to God to get an answer expect one. If you have not yet heard an answer from our Lord you need to continue to push until you get one, be persistent. We have no idea what our Father's plans are for each of us but He has the ability to place us in positions that can change the nation and the world, but have we been showing ourselves to be approved and used by Him? This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
