description: "This evening, Pastor Joshua Sosso talked about the book of Joshua. The time of Joshua was a time when all of God’s good promises came to pass. The only places that didn’t come to pass was when they didn't obey completely. We must obey what God tells us or the Transfer of Wealth won’t manifest. God promises us that we will own vineyards we didn't build. Joshua also instructed the Israelites to get rid of the idols, so they don't stumble and miss what God had. If we don't take inventory of our lives, the idols we don't even see can sabotage us. Even though we are marching forward, don’t forget all the things God has brought you through to get you here. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
