description: "The Transfer of Wealth is coming soon, so Pastor Cris asked if we are really ready for the manifestations of God. When the manifestation come, there will be people looking for ways to bring you down. What kind of sins do you continue to do that people can expose you for? God cannot use us mightily until we are pure and blameless so we don't fall because of our sins. We also need to be led by God in 2024. In Joshua 3, the Israelites followed the instructions of God to be led by the ark of the Covenant and he made a way through the impossible. God will do the same for us in 2024 if we follow the instructions to the letter. The impossible is becoming possible in 2024. We have to total sold out and prepared to receive it. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
