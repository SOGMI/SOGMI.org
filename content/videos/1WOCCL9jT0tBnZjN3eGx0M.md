description: "Pastor Cris speaks about the importance of preparing for the calling God has for us. For many of us, God has said that we are a part of the coming transfer of wealth, influence, and affluence. So if you truly believe that you are a part of it you will prepare accordingly. You will be preparing to managing wealth, manage people, and act with integrity concerning the areas God has given you. However this means that you need to be responsible with what you have now. Those things that you have, you need to make them more beautiful, more prosperous, and more efficient. Additionally do not chase after other people's callings or try to get involved in many things instead focus on the arena that God has placed you in. All of these things are essential for the transfer of wealth, influence, and affluence. It's time for Christians to mature and replicate after themselves. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 11, 2023."
