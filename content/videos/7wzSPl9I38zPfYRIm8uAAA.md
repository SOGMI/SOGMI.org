description: "Pastor Josh discusses lessons from our leadership and business training and the morning sermon from this day. God is moving us from the natural to the supernatural so we have to be able to rely on Him independently rather than rely on other people's anointing or others to manifest it. Seek God for His instructions for everything, follow Him, and start fresh. As God gave Noah all the specifications for the ark, we must follow God's instructions to the letter. Do not assume that you already know and do not be swayed by the opinions of man. Get out of your comfort zone and do a new thing in God, because He is doing new things in this world and we must be willing to step out of old habits. Everything will be heavenly and only God can take the glory. Commit yourself to the Lord, and that you'll put Him first above anything else. \n\nDeuteronomy 8:18\n\nThis sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 11, 2020."
