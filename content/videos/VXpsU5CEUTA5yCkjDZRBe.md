description: "This morning, Pastor Joshua Sosso talked about the power of God moving on our behalf. God is the one that anoints us and appoints us for the time we are in. Like in 1 Samuel 16, when Samuel was looking for the next king, Jesse brought all of his sons that he thought were qualified for the position. David being a king wasn't even a possibility in Jesse's mind. But God had David as the appointed king for Israel and no one else could take that place. David was minding his own business and God made him a king. But even when the word of God was spoken, David wasn't rise to the kingdom overnight. He still had to go back to tending the animals. When God speaks a word in your life, he has the appointed time for that word to come to pass and he will give you the power to go after what he spoke. Jesus mentions that his authority comes from God alone. We also have to have the mindset that God's word comes by the power of God, not our own. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
