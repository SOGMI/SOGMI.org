description: "When Moses went up to Mount Sinai for 40 days and 40 nights he was inundated with the presence of God. During that time God gave Moses detailed instructions concerning the temple, the priesthood, priestly garments, ceremonies, the 10 commandments and much, much more. Everything he needed to govern nation came from God. In the Transfer of Wealth, it must be the same for us. Everything needs to come from God. For many Christians there are numerous little habits, little ways of thinking that are not from God and they corrupt God's instructions. We need to ask God to reveal these things to us. Additionally, Pastor Cris delivers a prophetic instruction to the body of Christ to really pursue him and allow him to make us unlearn the things of the world for next 40 days. If we do that, we will see a dramatic transformation in this nation and in the business sector. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 31, 2022."
