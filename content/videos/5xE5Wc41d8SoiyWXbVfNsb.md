description: "In the old covenant, the priests were a class of people who were specially selected to serve in the tabernacle. Ordinary priests could enter the outer room, but only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year. This system created separate classes of people: ordinary people, priests, and high priests. Today, many Christians try to reestablish elements of this old covenant through various manmade system, and many pastors try to put themselves in the position of the high priest. However, it says in Hebrews 9:11 \"...Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation.\". Jesus is our high priest under the new covenant, and the move of the Spirit isn't subject to pastors but rather pastors a subject to the will of God. Jesus sanctified us through his blood so that we may all get access to God's presence. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on September 17, 2023."
