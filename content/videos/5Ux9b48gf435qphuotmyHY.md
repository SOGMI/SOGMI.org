description: "We have to be empowered by the Holy Spirit. Our own knowledge and understand is not enough to manifest the mighty move of God. It is only by faith and obedience to Him. So today if you hear His voice harden not your hearts. In addition, continue to work on your business plans and seek Him out concerning the development of your businesses. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso on February 2, 2021 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
