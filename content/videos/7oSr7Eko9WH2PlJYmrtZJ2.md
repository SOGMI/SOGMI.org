description: "Pastor Mike Sosso continued on the prophetic training with five key points. These are the focus of spreading the gospel. The Word of God, The Will of God, The Heart of God, The Voice of God, and The Holiness of God. The bible is the Word of God, it details all His instructions. The Will of God is that all men be saved. The Heart of God is proven all throughout the scriptures by the continual grace, mercy and forgiveness He has given to all of us. The Voice of God is that still small voice that is often clouded by all the noise of modern technology and worlds fast pace. Even with all that noise if you be still and listen His voice is as clear as day. Lastly The Holiness of God, to be in His presence is to be in complete peace, to be aware of all your flaws, to be in complete awe of His presence. Just like the disciples on the mountain who fell to their faces in His presence. You are encouraged to play this teaching on repeat to soak up all the fruits of this message. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 27, 2023 by Pastor Mike Sosso."
