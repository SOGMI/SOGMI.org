description: "Pastor Mike focused this morning on the Prayer of the tongues. When you pray in the Holy Spirit you are praying the perfect prayer that is coming directly from God Himself through you. He also spoke of keeping our minds on the things of the kingdom, to edify ourselves by speaking in the spirit. God has set us here to be the governing body of this world, not by ourselves but with Him. If you are ever feeling like you are lost and not know what to pray, open your mouth and speak in tongues. It was a very pleasant reminder that even when it seems that the world is spiraling out of control, our Father up in heaven is laughing because the day of His return is coming. So like we have been told several times fret not because the Kingdom of Our God is at hand. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October, 29, 2023 by Pastor Mike Sosso"
