description: "God has the masterplan in our life and He sees the big picture. We are all in training and we must get out of our own understanding. It's not about us. We must get the Word inside us and get rid of whatever is in us that would hinder the Holy Spirit. Take up your cross daily and get out of the way. If we are willing and obedient, we'll eat the fat of the land. Don't fret, trust in the Lord and do good. Delight yourself in the Lord and develop your relationship with Him so that we can be proven trustworthy with the anointing. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 25, 2021."
