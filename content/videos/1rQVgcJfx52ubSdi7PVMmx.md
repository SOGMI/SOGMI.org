description: "We are inheritors of Abraham's promise, so just as God said that He would make Abraham into a great nation, those that bless him He would bless, and those who curse him He would curse, this is part of our promise. As a Christian nation established on Christian principles, this is part of our inheritance. Expand your vision and get past self-focus and get to global focus because it only takes a few people who are willing to go all in with obeying God to change the course of a nation. Pastor Josh shares the example of John Quincy Adams who declared that slavery was a sin before the sight of God and dedicated himself to seeing the goal God placed in his heart to completion. He declared Luke 4:18-19 over himself, that the Spirit of the Lord was upon him because He anointed Him to preach the gospel to the poor... and to bring liberty to the captives. We must see the Kingdom of God and pursue it like nothing else. Be part of the correction that needs to happen in this nation and be willing to obey God with compromise. We are empowered to empower others. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 4, 2021."
