description: "This morning, Pastor Josh focused on the book of 2 Kings and the story of Naaman. Naaman's own expectations and pride caused him to delay his obedience to God. In the same way, we cannot allow our own expectations and pride to delay us and put God in a box. God moves in unexpected ways, so we should not limit Him with our expectations. We must remember that we are held liable to what God has instructed us to do. If we delay things or are disobedient, we are held accountable for how that impacts others. So let us allow God to lead us and set our expectations. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
