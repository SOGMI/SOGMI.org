description: "Many of the problems Christians run into today are because they love themselves more than God. When you are in love with somebody, you always consider that person. Whenever you make a decisions, you do it with them in mind. We need to learn to fall in love with Jesus. Once we get into that mindset, and we get into a mindset of obedience things, will start to manifest in our lives. In the same way, we need to also love others. There is no room for jealousy or malice in the Body of Christ. We need to be motivated by love. If we cannot love others then why would God entrust us with the Kingdom? This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 16, 2022."
