description: "Under the new covenant we institute circumcision of the heart, which is crucifying the flesh. When we walk according to the Spirit of God, we will put to death the ways of the flesh. Galatians 5:16, \"So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.\" It is essential that we allow the Holy Spirit to discipline us so that the flesh will not rule over us. For if we still operate in the flesh how can we leap into the supernatural? This sermon was delivered by Gary and Paula Nations at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 16, 2022.\n"
