description: "A friendly reminder that God has given us an ultimatum, we either choose Him or choose the world. Many of push His love by continuing to sin with the knowledge that if we ask He will forgive us. Those will reap what they have been sowing. Many if not all of us Christ followers are being corrected. Why? Because of the love that our Father has for us. If He did not care for us, He would not have corrected us. We should not be in this move of God for the gain of wealth and influence but to build the Kingdom Of God. Instead of boasting for status in the world system, we should be boasting on how much we have been gaining for the Kingdom. This is a wonderful time in this nation, our Father has said that the best is yet to come. Challenges will come, and all those who are being challenged, rejoice! Our Father does not get us out of challenges He wants us to overcome. For those of you who have no challenges, question your walk. Do not be like that Israelites who tried to push themselves into the promise land. God blesses those who are trustworthy but He does not owe us anything. Ask yourself when was the last time you were on fire for God? When was the last time that He was all that your can think about? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 11, 2024 by Pastor Cristina and Joshua Sosso\n"
