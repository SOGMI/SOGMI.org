description: "We in the Body of Christ must count ourselves of no reputation God is the one who will establish us. In knowing that remember and focus on God's promises and His Word. If we focus on God and follow and obey Him we will see Him work the supernatural. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International. During this service Pastor Cris also gives a tribute to Jasmin Espino a long time partner and supporter of Sons of God Ministries International."
