description: "This evening, Pastor Joshua Sosso focused on getting rid of pride and selfishness in the Church. Our own selfishness often gets in our way in the move of God. Understand that this is a form of adulatory, which will have us removed and replaced in this coming transfer of wealth. (James 4:6)\nWe are being raised up to remove the nations of this world that have been taken by the wicked. We now live in a self-centered culture, because the Church has allowed it. If we are going to break this thinking in the culture, we must first break it in the Church. Pastor Joshua also gave examples of prideful kings whos heads got too big for their own good. For example, King Uzziah's pride lead him to a life of solitude and leprosy (2 Chronicles 26:19-21). We have to shoot for God's perfect will and believe that one day every industry in this world will be led by God fearing Christians. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
