description: "A packed message tonight from Mrs. Paula Nations of accountability, trust and faithfulness. God has need from us all. We have been placed here to bring heaven down on earth. Are we allowing ourselves to be properly trained? Are we placing the Holy Spirit, Christ, God front and center. What is your training ground? Where ever we are placed now, is our training. Whether you are running a business or flipping a burger, there is something there for you to learn. David was in the pasture watching sheep. He was in the palace playing music for Saul. He was a warrior. All of these areas were his training ground. What do you think he was doing in that pasture? spending time with God of course. Thats key ladies and gentlemen, alone time with God. We must make it a priority to spend time with Jesus. If you do this you will begin to see that your love for the Father will grow, you will stop looking at the Word of dos and don'ts. Mrs. Paula had so much good to say and I encourage you to rewatch and take notes. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 25, 2023 by Mrs. Paula Nations.\n"
