description: "This Christmas season it's important to spend time celebrating the greatest gift that has been given to us - Jesus Christ. The birth of Jesus was an event like no other. It was something that had been prophesied for years and years, and when it happened the world would never be the same again. The whole world crossed the threshold into something new that has never happened before. During this Christmas season God also intends to bring us into a new arena that we have never ventured into before. We're leaping into glory. This sermon was delivered by Nicole Mendoza at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 22, 2021."
