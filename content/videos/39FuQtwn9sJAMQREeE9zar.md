description: "God has given us the beginning of the formula to manifest the supernatural in the earth. In II Timothy 2 it gives us the model of a soldier, a farmer, and an athlete and how we should incorporate certain aspects of them into our walk with Christ. The Body of Christ must step into leadership and must mature. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 19, 2020."
