description: "Pastor Josh continued to harken on the idea from this morning that time is of the essence for us to get our hearts right. Pastor Josh focused on the story of Jonah and how Jonah neglected the plan of God. Jonah ran from God and God continued to give him second chances. God didn't have to use Jonah, but he was merciful even when Jonah did his own thing. Pastor Josh also brings up the story of Sampson. Sampson's parents obeyed all the commands of the Lord, but Sampson was so arrogant to do his own thing. However, God used him despite his arrogance to kill the Philistines. In both of these stories, God was merciful when they did their own plans. Can you imagine how great Sampson and Jonah would have been if they followed God's will? God has continued to give us second chances while we did our own thing. It is time for us to do soul searching and turn our lives to God's plan. Let's not make God wait for another generation. We need to get in line now, before it's too late. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
