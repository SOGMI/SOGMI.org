description: "Pastor Josh reminds us not to look at our current situation, but to stand on the word of God that he gave us. He used the example of Elizabeth that was told by God she would have a baby, even in old age. She stood by that word and followed everything the Lord told her. We have the chance to experience even more miracles in this day.\n"
