description: "Once you begin to obey God you will be surprised at how far He takes you. Your situation doesn't matter. If you focus on God and obey Him, it doesn't matter how impossible it is, He will turn it around. God has already spoken \"the United States of America will turn towards righteousness\". So let us stand on His Word and begin implementation. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on January 27, 2021."
