description: "The Church needs to not be distracted by the chaos in the world. We need to focus on the things of God and look at others with the eyes of love. Don't allow yourself to be busy with your own plans; we should make ourselves busy with the things God is doing. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 11, 2020."
