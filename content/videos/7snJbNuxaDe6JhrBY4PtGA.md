description: "We had the privilege of hearing from Deborah Ferrel this morning on our identity in Christ. She focuses on how we can't stand idly by any longer while there are people that need to be saved. She asks the question, \"Can people really see Jesus in us?\" We have to walk confidently in our identity so we can transform people into God's kingdom. We don't have time to compromise during this season of implementation. It's time to burn our old identities and walk in our identity in Christ. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX. "
