description: "It is time to celebrate and praise the Lord, because He has already decreed His Word over the United States of America and the Philippines. God is faithful and because He is faithful every promise has spoken for His Church and the nations will surely come to pass. Let us all step out in faith and complete obedience so that we too can be a part of this move. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 19, 2021."
