description: "Pastor Josh focused on the book of Joshua this evening because it is relevant to the Transfer of Wealth that we are experiencing. In Joshua 1, the Lord give the Israelites strict instructions to get to the Promise Land. Then, in Joshua 3, the Lord allowed the Israelites to cross on dry ground in the Jordan to show that he was with them as he went forth. Later, when the Israelites defeated Jericho, the Lord told the Israelites the plunder belonged to Him and to covet the riches. However, one Israelite focused on the riches and cost him and his family their lives. This should be a wake up call to us to treat God and the instructions given to us as sacred. If God gives us the riches we have been asking for, we need to treat them as sacred and ask where to go next. If we move forward without God, we could lose everything that is promised to us. Treat every task and ability God has given you the same respect you give God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
