description: "Pastor Cris addresses the importance of unity in the Body of Christ. The 120 that were in the Upper Room were of one heart and one mind. They didn't have any other agendas, and in that the Holy Spirit shook the room and moved mightily. Additionally, every time the people of God were united in the heart and mind, they were prosperous, and the enemies of the Lord couldn't stand against them. We need this as we prepare to step into the move that God is bringing to this nation. We become united - first with Jesus, then with each other. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 01, 2022.\n"
