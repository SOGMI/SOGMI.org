description: "Prophets must be careful to prophesy only what the Lord has spoken. It is a very holy thing. They must ensure that they do not inject their own opinions or the opinions of others. When Ezekiel prophesied to the dry bones he said, \"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feetâ€”a vast army.\" (Ezekiel 37:10) It was got who gave the exact instruction and Ezekiel followed to the letter, and as a result something miraculous occurred. The same is true for our own instructions. Follow the instructions of the Lord to the letter, and don't listen to the opinions of others or even your own opinions. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 11, 2021."
