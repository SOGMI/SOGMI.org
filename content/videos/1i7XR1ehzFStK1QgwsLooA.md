description: "Pastor Josh shared with us how divine inspiration is brought into the world from the Holy Spirit. He gives multiple examples from Sir Isaac Newton and his discovery of gravity to Handel composing the Messiah chorus. We have to get into the presence of God to receive the God-breathed inspiration that he has for us. Be proactive in chasing after God!\n"
