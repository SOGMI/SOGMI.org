description: "We are preparing for the move of God, so we all need to keep in mind that we need to get our instructions and direction from our Father. It is also strongly encourage to write down the instructions that He has given you. You hold the instructions that have been given as Holy, do not let anyone persuade you in another direction. Beware of those who come in the name of the Father, but come out of jealousy and malice. You need to look at that spiritual, not only the physical. Do not become complacent once you feel like you have arrived, instead you need to continue trying to advance yourself in God's Kingdom. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International. On June 2, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
