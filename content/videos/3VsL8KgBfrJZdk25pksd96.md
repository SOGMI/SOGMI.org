description: "This evening, Pastor Josh reviews the recent trip to Washington DC and how intricate our founding fathers were including God in everything they did. He speaks on how we need to be aware of the things we are following because they will guide us to life or death. Sometimes it can be a false narrative or an ungodly principle that we are following without us even knowing about it. With the Transfer of Wealth, we need to get out of our own ways of thinking. The things that God gives us can be something that completely changes the industry that God has called us to be in. We are constantly in a mission field so we need to be able to hear the Holy Spirit at all times. The Church needs to prepared to be a light in every area we are called to.\n"
