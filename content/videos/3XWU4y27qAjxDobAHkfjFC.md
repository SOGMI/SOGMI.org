description: "We might look at the obstacles that God puts in our life and think we aren't capable of completing the task. However, God will never put us in a situation that we cannot handle. Pastor Cris shared that we should change our mindset and focus on pleasing God, rather than the hardships we are going through. We need to be excited for the things ahead! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
