description: "We have all the power and authority in Christ, and He will produce surprises and manifestations in your life as you obey and follow Him. In this season we need to focus on obeying God and making things right. Don't worry about \"what you could've done\". Instead focus on what God is asking you to do now! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on April 16, 2021."
