description: "In Matthew 24, Jesus explains how no one knows the time or the hour when Son of God will come. The truth is God's move is very much the same. We do not know when God will come to inspect the fruit we have produced much like Jesus with the fig tree. We don't have any time to waste for we do not want to be taken by surprise or be unprepared when the Lord is ready to move. We must allow the Holy Spirit to guide us and lead us today! When you do this, you will start to learn what it truly means to be a kind and priest in every area of your life - including business. You will also learn what you must do to make God Lord of your life and Lord of your destiny, which is essential to be a part of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 30, 2022. \n"
