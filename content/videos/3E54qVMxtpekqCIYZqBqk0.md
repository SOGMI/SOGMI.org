description: "If you are just sitting around \"waiting on God\" for the desires of your heart to manifest then you are missing the big picture. God's mighty move is here but it will only manifest in the lives of those that are desperate to seek after God and obey Him! Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God waiting for us to make His enemies a footstool for His feet. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 4, 2021. "
