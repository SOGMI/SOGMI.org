description: "This Morning we began the service with a word from Mrs. Paula pertaining to California and its turn back to Christ. Amen to that. There is a Jesus revolution happening in California and we as the body should not raise a negative word against it. A word was given through Pastor Cristina, you do not preach something that you yourself do not believe or have not walked yourself. We need to take ourselves to our prayer closets and get empowered by Christ all over again, forget everything you think you know, ask Jesus to show us our heart issues so that we can address them. One of of our biggest flaws and stumbling blocks is that we often confuse our own voices with that of the Lord. You have to have your quiet time with the Lord. This transfer of wealth will not manifest without Jesus being the center. Let go of your head knowledge! Everyday should be a new day, a fresh start, a reset. Before you fall asleep keep the instructions, lay heads on yourself and minister. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 10, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
