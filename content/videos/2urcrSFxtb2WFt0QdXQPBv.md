description: "This Sunday night we have a triple serving! Pastor Mike shares a song for our times and Pastor Cris continues her message about how judges are now emerging in the Church. Pastor Joshua follows up with the main message about how God's judgement is just. We must be an example for others to follow and show reverence for what the Lord is about to do. The uprooting of the wicked means that the righteous have to be blameless so that He can deal with the wicked. We are excited for this move of God and we are declaring the victory! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 13, 2020. "
