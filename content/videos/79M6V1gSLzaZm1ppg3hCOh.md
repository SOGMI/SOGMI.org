description: "As we celebrate Independence Day it's important to remember the promises God has already spoken over this nation. Political revival is here! We don't need to pray for it. It is already here! God reigns forever and if we focus on and turn to God this nation will be blessed beyond measure. Psalms 33:12 \"Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for his inheritance.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 4, 2021."
