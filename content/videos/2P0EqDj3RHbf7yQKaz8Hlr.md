description: "The theme for tonight's message was that God's goodness is going to overtake us. We don't have to beg for it, God is ready to pour out his spirit. Pastor Cris started with a word from the Lord that his goodness is going to run after us. She also shares that God isn't going to satisfy our emotions and doing so will only satisfy our flesh. We only fail when we go by our emotions. We have to use our spiritual lenses in situations to see where God is taking us. Pastor Cris also focuses on being uncomfortable during this time. We need to stretch ourselves from what our flesh wants. How can we expect to have companies if we are focused on staying in our comfort zone now. If we are able to follow the instructions to the letter now, we will be able to follow God's instructions to the letter. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
