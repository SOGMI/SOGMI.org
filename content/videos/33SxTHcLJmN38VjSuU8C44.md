description: "The Body of Christ needs to take hold of the healing power that God wants to manifest in the Church. Put your faith into action and do it passionately! The faith of others can produce healing in others in the same way the man who was let down through the roof was healed in the New Testament. Healing for our bodies, the land, the water, situations and other people can be produced by our obedience through Christ. So be expectant of the remarkable and believe that God can work miracles through you. Be committed that no matter what you will pursue God, and take your position in the Body of Christ! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso and Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 14, 2021."
