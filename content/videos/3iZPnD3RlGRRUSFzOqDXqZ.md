description: "This evening service touched on the importance of having God as your center, in everything that you do it is essential to run it through the Father. If we get into the habit of doing things the way we believe is the right way and completely leaving God out of our decisions, how will God be able to trust and use us in the future? Our rebellion causes God to withdraw from us because of His mercy. Be like Moses. He made it clear that he will do or go nowhere if Gods presence did not go with them. Let us make a huge step towards Gods perfect will for our lives by including him in every decision we make, whether big or small. In this way it would become second nature for us. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 28, 2022."
