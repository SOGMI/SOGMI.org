description: "This year 2022 you will know what to do if you trust and obey God. The key is to ask God for wisdom. It says in James 1:5 \"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.\" God will generously give you the wisdom you need when you seek Him out and ask Him. This is essential for the Body of Christ to get as God prepares us for the transfer of wealth, influence, and affluence. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Mike Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 26, 2022."
