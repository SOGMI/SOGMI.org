description: "Pastor Josh talks about how we should follow the instructions to the letter and not deviate from what the Lord has told us. We are in the harvest time and the Lord is separating the tares from the wheat. Despite all the circumstances, God is doing great things behind the scenes. It is our prayer that the scales will fall from our eyes so that we all will see into the supernatural realm. This sermon was given by Pastor Joshua Sosso on November 29th, 2020 at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
