description: "Joshua and Caleb believed and obeyed God, but because of the other Israelites around them their possession of the Promised Land was delayed by 40 years. The old generation had to pass away so that a new generation could come up. In this way you manifestations and blessings can be delayed by those you surround yourself with. So you must be mindful of your associations. Likewise we also must become focused on where God is leading us rather than what we want. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 08, 2021."
