description: "It's time for the Body of Christ to uproot those roots that are not connected to God's ways of doing things. In order for us to be partakers of the transfer of wealth influence and affluence, we need to be planted in Christ not the world's system.\n\nThis sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 6th, 2019."
