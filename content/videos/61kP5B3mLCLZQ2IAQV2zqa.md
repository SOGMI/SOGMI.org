description: "Returning from her trip, Pastor Cris discusses instructions the Lord gave to her concerning the Transfer of Wealth, Influence, and Affluence from the Book of Ephesians. It is important for us to study these things and implement them in our life. It is the will of God that we all will prosper, and always remember we are called not just for ourselves, but our ministry needs to be for the profit of all. We are blessed to be a blessing. So let us ensure that our hearts become pure and that we step into obedience so that God can use us mightily. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 10, 2022."
