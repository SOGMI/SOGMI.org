description: "Pastor Josh focused on the idea of being in tune with the Holy Spirit for where God is placing you. We have to go back to the basics of where everything has to be focused on God. It has to be natural for us to be in the supernatural. Daniel was an example Pastor Josh used as someone who was in the supernatural. Daniel always remembered God while interpreting people's dreams, and people that didn't even believe in God knew Daniel was operating in the supernatural. We have to be ready for the situation that crosses our path. Whether that is in business or in healings, we should be ready to go at all times. The new ideas and inventions for the kingdoms God is placing in are coming from visions from Heaven. Be ready to receive what God has for you. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
