description: "Pastor Josh focuses on our faith walk and doing it for the right reasons. Like a blacksmith, when gold is melted down, they mold it into whatever they desire. That is the same process we need God to use on our lives. We cannot keep going the same way if we desire to follow the plan of God. Money cannot be the sole focus for following God. We have to let go of our own desires and God will prosper us in wherever he leads us. Allow God to purge your life to see the way he can use you. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
