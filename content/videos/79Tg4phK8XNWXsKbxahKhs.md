description: "In John 11 Lazarus became sick, but Jesus didn't immediately go to heal him. This is despite the fact that Jesus had immediately left to heal other people in the past. The reason why is that Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit and God had a bigger plan in mind. Lazarus died as a result of his sickness and then Jesus raised him from the dead. The purpose of this was outlined in John 11:40 when Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\" We have to understand that God's plans our bigger than our plans and if we focus on what's in front of us we will completely miss it. We have to be led by the Holy Spirit. If we insist on our way we are in the way! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 28, 2022."
