description: "What have we been doing since became Christians? Have we been standing on the sidelines? Have we been to work all that we have been learning? Are we still struggling to walk out our healings? Walking, talking, acting, and even dressing like all that we have asked for from our Father has already manifested. Time and time again we have told that if we are not receiving our manifestations, we need to get to our prayer closet and ask our Father what is the heart issue that we still have not been addressing. Do we still rely on our Pastors to do all the walk for us? If we are not getting the answers we desire are we bothering other pastors? Start your own ministry if you feel like you need to take the mic or take the stage from your pastor, but you better make sure that you run that through the Father. Our goal should never been to get the numbers of attendees , but to bring all that we can reach to Christ. We are need to take a step back and look at our own hearts, ask the Father to help us clean up ourselves before we try to point to others flaws. Each and everyone of us should be working with a heart of God. We should not be waiting for others downfall. Pray for them and their salvations. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 13, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
