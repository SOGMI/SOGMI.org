description: "This morning, Pastor Cris and Josh focused on topics that are important to the church. We need to address the things the Body of Christ is touching that are not from God. There are gates that are being open to the entertainment industry and we need to be ready. Pastor Josh focused on the letters from Paul and how his personal letters are still items we discuss to this day. Paul was following the spirit in doing ordinary things and now his obedience is touching our hearts today. God is looking for obedient hearts that will obey in every task to bring forth the Transfer of Wealth. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
