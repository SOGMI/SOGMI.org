description: "Isaiah 43:18-19 tells us \"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See I am doing a new thing...\" So if He is doing a new thing then it's time we drop our old ways of doing things. Our old habits and way of thinking a primary factor in delaying the manifestations that God wants to bring about in our lives. We the Church need to give the Holy Spirit permission to disrupt our schedule and plans, and allow Him to direct us. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 7, 2021."
