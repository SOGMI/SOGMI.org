description: "The glory of God is going to manifest in this season. To prepare for it we need to seek out God's presence and His glory. In II Chronicles 7:3 it says, \"When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord, saying, 'He is good; his love endures forever.'\" When God reveals His glory, you become more aware of His characteristics. This is the reason why you need to experience God's glory. Many preachers are preaching about God, but they do not know God. However, if you get into the glory of God's presence you will get to know God more and more intimately. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 01, 2021."
