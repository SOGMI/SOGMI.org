description: "This evening Pastor Joshua talked about Jesus being the model of what it takes to partake in the transfer of wealth. In everything we must be led by the Holy Spirit, be faithful to God's commands and be able to lead when put into a position of authority. We need to be in continual conversation with God until it becomes second nature. \"In order to bear fruit, you have two choices, to be chopped or to be pruned.\" - Pastor Christina Sosso\nThis sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 13, 2022."
