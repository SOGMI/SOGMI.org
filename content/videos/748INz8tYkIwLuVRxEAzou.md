description: "As God is preparing to move mightily in His Body we need to revist the instructions He gave us concerning the transfer of wealth. We need to prove ourselves faithful in the little things that God has given us now so that God can trust us with greater things. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Michael Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 31, 2021."
