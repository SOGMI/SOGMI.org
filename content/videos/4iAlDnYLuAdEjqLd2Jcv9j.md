description: "In the world's system the odds of your destiny manifesting may be extremely slim, but it doesn't matter to God. What were the odds that Moses would wind up being taken in by the Pharoh's wife? What were the odds that Esther would be selected out of all the other women? But God made those things happen. God is more than able to do the same in your life. For God the greater the odds are stacked against you the greater the glory God will recieve as a result. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 25, 2020."
