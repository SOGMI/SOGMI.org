description: "The Church needs to start treating God as Holy and sovereign. We cry out to God to bring revival but don't obey Him. We need to stop squandering the opportunities God has given us. Ephesians 5:15-16 states, \"Be very careful, then, how you liveâ€”not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 11, 2022.\n"
