description: "God tells us be holy as I am Holy. He is opening doors for us, golden opportunities and He requires a certain amount of obedience from us and faith put into action. If we truly acted as if we believed God as we say, then the way we carry out our life would look very different. Our opinions and schedules wouldn't be our top priority. Pastor Josh encourages us to allow God to lead you this week. Submit yourself to Him and put your faith and obedience into action. Consecrate yourself as the Israelites were instructed by Joshua in Joshua 3:5, \"Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 4, 2021."
