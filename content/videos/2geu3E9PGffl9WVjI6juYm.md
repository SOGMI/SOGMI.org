description: "Pastor Cris focused heavily on following the patterns God has given you. Since this is the week before Pentecost we are expecting the Lord to manifest miracles this week and during our outside service next week. She references the book of Exodus and how God had specific instructions for the Tabernacle and every little detail. The businesses and ideas God has given you are from God and he will provide the step by step instructions on how to manifest the Transfer of Wealth. If you hear any instructions from God, follow them immediately so you don't look back with regret. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
