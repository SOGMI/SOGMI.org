description: "This evening, Pastor Joshua Sosso talked on how we need to be kingdom and spiritual minded with everything we do. Who are we going to focus on more? Pleasing God or pleasing man? We have to remember that what God calls us to, he is in charge of calling the shots. We cannot assume anything and allows ask the Lord before any move. If God called you to a specific area, it doesn't matter what your status is on earth. His word is going to come to pass, but he will pass us up if we don't focus. If God said it, we need to believe it. We do not want to miss the next train. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
