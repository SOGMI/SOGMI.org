description: "This evening's service was a reminder that we are all in a preparation stage. Our Father is bringing the transfer of wealth our way in his timing, so all we need to do is come to the Father and ask him  to teach us what our task is. Let us not focus on others callings, but to focus on our own. What can we do to help bring His will down on Earth. Remember that God does not ask us if we are qualified, he simply appoints us. So don't panic if you feel out of your element, if you aren't in you desired position or job, as long as you stay in line with our Father, he will prepare you. As Christ believers no matter how hard it may get or how unbelievable a task may seem to accomplish, in our hearts we know God is with us no matter what. After all our Father loves surprises. So it is time to get excited for 2023! This sermon was given on November 16, 2022 at Freedom Fellowship Church by Pastor Christina Sosso.  "
