description: "This morning, Pastor Cris spoke on some tough topics on what is stopping us from seeing our manifestations. If we keep idolizing ourselves or others and let jealousy get in the way, it will continue to destroy our opportunities. We have to shift our focus and use the time to advance the kingdom of God. As long as we are here on earth, there is something we can do for the glory of God and push forward to preach the gospel to all nations. We have to discipline ourselves to follow God's instructions without changing it or giving our opinions. In order to stay on the course of the instructions, we need to be praying constantly for your job and what God has given you. If you can understand or analyze it, it is not the ways of God. Let God make your plan and you diligently walk towards it. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
