description: "Pastor Cris focuses on the life of Joseph and how he affected the whole world. Even though Joseph was sold into slavery and thrown in jail, we always focus on the great rise to second in command that God provided for him. Joseph had influence on the entire world except Pharaoh. Pastor Cris tells us this is what the Transfer of Wealth is going to be. Not only will there be great riches that come along with it, but our obedience will be for the profit of the whole earth. We have to change our mindset so our priorities are God's priorities which is changing and saving the entire world. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
