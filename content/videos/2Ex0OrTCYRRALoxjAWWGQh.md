description: "We are entering a new season where God will show us hidden things. We must be humble enough to recognize that we don't know what's next, so we must seek God out for His revelation. Make yourself available to hear God, because like Joseph, He is blessing us with resources so we can step into positions of authority. it should be so self-evident that it is the hand of God working in our lives, since none of us will be in a position to take care of it, that those who see us can only attribute the results to God. All it takes is simple acts of obedience! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on April 16, 2021.\n"
