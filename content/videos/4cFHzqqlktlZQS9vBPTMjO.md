description: "Pastor Cris reminds us that Holy Spirit will be our leader during the Transfer of Wealth. Since the Transfer of Wealth is God's idea, we'll be led by him to achieve the supernatural. God will not share his glory, even a small part of it. Do what you can do to see the manifestations of God. Like men and women in the Bible, they heard from God and believed in his word. We can ask for the Holy Spirit to fill us every day so we can see where God is leading us. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
