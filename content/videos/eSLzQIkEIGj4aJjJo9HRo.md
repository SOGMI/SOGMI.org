description: "I Corinthians 15:50 says, \"I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.\" We have to separate the flesh from the spiritual realm, because our the weapons of our warfare are not carnal (II Corinthians 10:4). When we operate in the flesh we are subject to the world's system, but when we allow the Holy Spirit to move in us we can move supernaturally. In the Body of Christ things are not fair in fact we have the advantage because the Spirit of the Living God is dwelling within us. Let us get on the offensive to tear down the works of the Devil and establish the Kingdom of God. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 30, 2022.\n"
