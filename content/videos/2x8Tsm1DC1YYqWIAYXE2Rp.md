description: "Pastor Cris starts out tonight asking us to identify the idols in our life as they can cost us time in our manifestations. With all the manifestations that are about to come, we need to ask God to increase our capacity to receive. She also focuses heavily on using our faith to manifest our healing. When we make a choice in our hearts that we are healed because God said so, we have to stand firmly with our faith no matter what the circumstances look like. As Pastor Cris says, you have to walk, talk and dress healed. We have to mature our faith, so we don't miss out on the opportunities that are coming. Ask God to show you what is stopping your breakthroughs from coming forth. The time to stand with our faith is now."
