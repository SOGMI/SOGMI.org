description: "Happy fourth of July, everyone! This mornings service focused on the foundation of the United States, we are a nation under God. Examples were given of all the occasions that our Father God lifted His hands against those who tried to take what we have dedicated to Him. Though we may not like what has happened in the past, it is important to keep in mind where we came from. Now we are to focus on the great commission and the goodness of our God, everything He is doing for this nation, and not to focus on the ugly that is going on around us. If we forget that we risk the wicked continuing to run this nation. We were all wicked once and sadly behind closed doors some of us are, now is is the time to correct and pray for those who push back on our Fathers will. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 2, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
