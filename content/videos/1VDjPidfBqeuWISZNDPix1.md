description: "Pastor Josh talks to us the mighty works that God is going to do. In the Bible, the disciples had no idea the miraculous work that God was going to perform. They were led by the Holy Spirit to be used for the supernatural. The same thing goes for us. We have no idea what God is going to do in this earth, but we are excited to see what is to come. Pastor Josh also goes on to say that whatever God speaks to us, it should take up our everyday thoughts. We need to have a hunger for the Holy Spirit to take over us. Get out of the way and allow the Holy Spirit to fill you. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
