description: "A powerful sermon by Pastor Cristina, we were reminded that we have been called to serve our Father in Heaven and to spread His word throughout the nations. The state of our country and world has been a direct reflection of our mouths and lack of obedience. Its time for us to ask ourselves, \" Has God called me?\" And if He has, it is time for us to grow up and stop compromising ourselves to our flesh. Its time for us to understand that if our Father has given us this task, don't you think He knows how it will be done or funded? All we have to do is trust Him and step out. Pastor Cristina has given a number of examples of how her obedience and many others has funded out of country missions. No one said that following God's instructions would be a walk in the park, but the trip along the way is so fulfilling. So we need to get out of ourselves and obey His instructions, because there will be repercussions out of our understanding.\nHe will never give up on you, but you giving up on yourself causes Him to step back. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 21, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
