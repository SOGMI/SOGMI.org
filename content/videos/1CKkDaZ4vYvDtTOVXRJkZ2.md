description: "Pastor Cristina reminded us on the instructions from this past Sunday about spending time with God for 40 days and nights. She also references the twelve spies regarding the Promise Land and how the ten negative spies cost the nation of Israel the promise land for years. Pastor Cris also calls for us to pray for the United States and China as nations. During these 40 days and beyond, we need to allow God to rearrange our schedule and don't allow anyone to talk you out of what God says."
