description: "This evening, Pastor Mike shared how the Church is the governing body on the earth and our prayers are what is going to cause changes. Jesus gave authority on the earth to the church, so we have the authority of Jesus to rule and reign here. But the only way we will be ready to govern is by praying in the Spirit. When we pray in the Spirit, we get in tune of what God is wanting to do in the earth and we don't push our own agenda. Whatever God is assigning you to pray for, you have to picture yourself in authority over everything. We are the governing body in the earth and Jesus has given us the keys to authority. It is time for us to take our posts and govern like we are called to do. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
