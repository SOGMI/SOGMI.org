description: "This evening, Pastor Josh focused on really making the Holy Spirit and God at the center of our lives. By having God guide us in our life, he will empower us to the place we are supposed to be. You might not feel called in the area God is putting you in, but continuing to focus on God in the times of insecurity will put you in his perfect will. Enroll in the school of the Holy Spirit and have him lead you in all your ways. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX. "
