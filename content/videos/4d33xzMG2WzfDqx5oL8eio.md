description: "Stop focusing on the problem and focus on being a part of the solution. Murmuring and complaining only causes problems and displeases the Lord, instead focus on the goodness of God and seeking out where He is leading you to go. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on May 3, 2020."
