description: "In Psalm 91:14-16 it says \"'Because he loves me,' says the Lord, 'I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.'\" Take this Scripture and personalize it in your life. When you love on God and obey Him he cannot help but move in your life. When you are in trouble be the kind of person that calls on God first. When there's bad news focus on His goodness. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 5, 2021"
