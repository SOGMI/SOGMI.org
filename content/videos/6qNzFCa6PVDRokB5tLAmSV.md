description: "It's time to get rid of presumptuousness in the Body of Christ. No longer should a situation arise where you say, \"Well I thought this is what God wanted me to do.\" We need to take responsibility for our actions and start obeying God as he directs us, and obey Him to the letter. When Saul disobeyed God he didn't take responsibility for his actions he instead tried to shift the blame away from Himself. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 02, 2021."
