description: "A very powerful message this morning, we have been give a word from our Father, that the great divide is now. He has said that we are to make a decision now, whether we are going to walk with Christ with all our hearts or are we going to continue to dabble in the world. If we do not make this choice, it will be made for us. Let go of all this religiosity, all this preaching of law a legalism, all the gloom and doom and what is going on in this world. Instead we need to stick to the gospel of Acts. The disciples only focused on the Kingdom of God. They spread the gospel of the lord Jesus Christ, as shall we. Take action now! Why are we waiting for signs and wonders to happen before we act? We should be out there spreading the gospel of Jesus, making the signs and wonders happen, making disciples of all men. We weren't called to be spectators, but doers of the word. each and everyone of us has a calling and a plan preordained by our Father, things beyond our own expectations, it is only our own faults and actions that keep us from all those blessings. Choose now to walk the path of Christ, to study yourself approved. This is a war for our country. A war between the kingdom of God and the ways of the world, and we all already know which side wins. What side will you be on? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 24, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso"
