description: "This evening Pastor Joshua Sosso speaks on having faith and the refining process.To have faith, we need to understand spiritual authority. We must go through the cleansing process to hear from the Lord.  Speak things as though they were, not as they are currently. It's time for our faith to reach full maturity. There are so many blessings, power, and many responsibilities that God has for us. Our faith and obedience can't be outsourced to somebody else. We have to be the ones to act out our faith and obedience.We can't go back to the old, but we need to press into the new. This Sermon was given by Pastor Joshua Sosso of Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 17th, 2024."
