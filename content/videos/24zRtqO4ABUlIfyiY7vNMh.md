description: "There are plenty of times where the Spirit of God spoke something into the world and it called it forth. Ed reminds us of a few places where Jesus spoke something into being and created a miracle. We are reminded that we have that same power and so much more when we follow the instructions of the Lord. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
