description: "In this year 2022, we need to submit to God in everything. If you are willing, you will find that God will command you to do things that you don't want to do or something that you aren't comfortable with. When that happens, get excited. God is leading you into the supernatural. If you are still doing the things that you like doing and you aren't being made uncomfortable that is when you should be getting nervous. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 2, 2022."
