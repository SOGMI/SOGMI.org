description: "Pastor Cristina starts this morning off strong with some prophetic words from the Lord, reminding all of us that now is not the time to fall back and let others bring forth His manifestations to the earth. Some of us have a word of encouragement and some of us a reminder that our Father is watching each and everyone of us, those of us who have been following His instructions and those who have been taking advantage of His mercy and Love. Our disobedience will not be tolerated any longer, we will be replaced. For those of us who are dragging down our fellow brothers and sisters, remember our Father will not lose one of His children because of your selfishness. God's way is always better, he is renewing things for our sake and for the sake of all His people. Everything that we do must be do until Him, not for our own recognition. Our words are powerful, so it is important that we honor the things that we have committed to ourselves and most and importantly others. How many of us have asked the Father what He would like for us to do on Thanksgiving? We must repent because many of us have not even thought about asking. We are all made new. It is a new day so lets get our there and shine for Jesus.\n"
