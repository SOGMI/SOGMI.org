description: "For the Body of Christ this Christmas Season into 2021 will be a season of golden opportunities, meaning it's an excellent chance for us to get into the blessings of God. As we step into position God will bring about a reset for us as well as a reset for the nation. In this time find the will of God for your life and you do focus on that thing first and foremost. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 20, 2020."
