description: "Jesus's biggest opponents were the Pharisees and Sadducees. They were the spiritual leaders at the time, but they preferred to enforce manmade doctrines and traditions instead of allowing the move of God to take place. However Jesus spoke these words to those spiritual leaders, \"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.\" (Matthew 21:43) These Words will also come to pass today among those spiritual leaders who have tried limit the move of God in the Church. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso on March 17, 2021 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
