description: "The Lord spoke in Isaiah 1 the following, \"I will turn My hand against you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your alloy. I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.\" This is what God is doing to prepare the Church in this season. Concerning the judges, He has said that the Deborahs will be raised up in this season. This has already begun to manifest. In the Italy they just elected a woman prime minister who is a passionate Christian. The same thing is happening in other nations as well. All of these things are preparations for a move of God likes of which the Church has never seen in its history. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 28, 2022."
