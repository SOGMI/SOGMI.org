description: "Pastor Josh shares with us how our obedience in prayer has affected our country already. God has used unexpected people to protect our world. Like in 2 Kings, when the nation of Israel was experiencing famine, the word of the Lord was spoken that the famine would be gone by the morning. So who did God use to break the famine? Four men with leprosy caused the Arameans to flee in terror because the Lord used them mightily. We need to continue to seek the Lord and be obedient to the words given to us. No matter what the situation looks like. If the Lord spoke a decree, it will come to pass. Keep obeying the word of the Lord and situations in our world will continue to transform for good. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
