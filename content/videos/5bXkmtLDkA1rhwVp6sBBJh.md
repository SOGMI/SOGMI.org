description: "Pastor Josh continues on the topic of trusting in God in every area of our lives. We have to go all in on the promises God has given us and not waver from it. Pastor Josh shares some personal experiences where he trusted God in every area of his life, even though they weren't according to his own plans. We can't trust God halfway; we have to trust God the whole way. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International.\n"
