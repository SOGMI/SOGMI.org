description: "Pastor Cristina continues How To Hear The Voice Of God. We briefly recapped the first message by stating that in order to hear His voice we must first listen. Sometimes that means taking a step back from all the noise, all the distractions, (and there are many) your phone, your spouse, your kids even your home. Go for a ride alone, no music just you and the Father. Maybe you need to take a fast. A fast will clear your mind of all the junk, the noise, the enemy, as long as you take the time to be with the Lord. Pastor Cristina even threatens her flesh by telling it, it will not eat if it keeps acting up. It is natural to constantly be i battle with your flesh, because it will never stop trying to pull you down, but as long as we have open ears to hear our Father, we win that battle. Yes, sometimes we may fail, but we are not yet in our glorified body, get back up, repent and move forward. The love of the Father will never be separated from us.\nGet excited for the times that are here. Many of us have yet to actually feel what it is like to be in the presence of the Lord, we are not talking about heat and goosebumps, we are talking about a presence so real, so peaceful, so great that we will not want leave. Time slows for you, hunger and tiredness alludes you. A presence so beautiful that it will be all that you want. You will constantly seeking to have instructions from our Father to please the Father. \nDon't allow the enemy to keep you distracted or compromise what God has for us. He already has a plan for each and everyone one of us, plans to prosper us, plans for glory. God knows better than us after all. This message was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 12, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso"
