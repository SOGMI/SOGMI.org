description: "God will elevate us beyond even own ability through instructions through the Holy Spirit. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are prime examples of this. They were among the smartest, handsome and qualifies young men chosen for the king's service and they sought not to defile themselves to honor God. After they were tested, the king found none equal to them. In every matter of wisdom and understanding, they were found ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in the kingdom! This is what God has in store for us. Seek God first and everything we are striving for will be sorted out. Treat the vision and instructions that God gives us as sacred and let us watch what God will do in our generation. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 25, 2021."
