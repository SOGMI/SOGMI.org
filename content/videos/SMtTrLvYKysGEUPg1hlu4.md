description: "A wisdom filled sermon by Pastor Mike Sosso, speaking on the importance of shifting our mindset, focusing on the great commission, speaking in the spirit and giving thanks are just a few of the points that were hit tonight. To keep a watch over your mouths, because every word out of your mouth bring forth power whether it be a blessing or a curse. Be someone who isn't sitting on the side lines bickering but someone who intercedes in those affairs that go on around us and in our nation. Thank our Father for all that He is doing all around us and surrender to His will. You will go nowhere if you can't follow His simple instructions. Acknowledge that you can not do it on your own. Our Father is there for us, to back us up and help us fight the principalities of the world. You'd be amazed where our Father can place you if you just seek Him out. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 22, 2024 by Pastor Mike Sosso. "
