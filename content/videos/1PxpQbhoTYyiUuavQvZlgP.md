description: "Men dominating women is something that came with the curse. The way the Church has been preaching about marriage and submission in the Church has been wrong, but there is freedom in Christ Jesus. The law was created to teach us that we need a savior and that we cannot be saved through works. However if we catch what God is trying to show us we are going to life Heaven on Earth. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 5, 2021."
