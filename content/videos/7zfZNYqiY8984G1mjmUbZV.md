description: "Pastor Cris started the message with instructions for the Philippines and their upcoming election. She reminds us that even here in the United States, we need to pray for our political leaders. Pastor Cris also focuses on the book of Ezekiel and the vision that revealed in the first chapter. As Christians, we need to focus on the solution instead of the problem. We have to do the right thing regardless of the circumstances, as it will be accredited as righteousness. Focus on the light of the Kingdom and continue to walk in it. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
