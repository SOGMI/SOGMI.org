description: "This evening, Pastor Josh explained we gotta go to the secret place with God. We need God in a way that completely changes our lifestyle. We cannot continue the same way and expect a different result. The best time to obey the Lord is today! But we have to build our faith and obedience like we train our body. We cannot get to what God has for us using the faith of others. God has given you instructions and industries to conquer. Now is the time to move forward and take the time to hear from God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
