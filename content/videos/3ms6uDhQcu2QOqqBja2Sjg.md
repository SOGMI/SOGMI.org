description: "All opportunities will be opened up to you, when you listen and obey our Fathers instructions. Psalms 31:19 says that He has stored up treasures for us who take refuge and honor Him, so much that it overflows. All our struggles to get a leg up in business or status is all for nothing, a waste of our time and energy. Through are Father, we could have it all. All without breaking a sweat. God works in the impossible, through Him doors can be open that we could have never imagined for ourselves. It's time to get your mindset in line with our Father's, and that is that all things are possible. The poverty mentality is for the past and we live for the now. Speak to yourself, that you are anointed, appointed, and and ready for God's move. Regardless of what you may feel about yourself, you speak as if it is already done for you. If you mess up, you get up, dust off, repent and keep moving forward. Focus on our Father and not what is going on around us. We are making history, so move with integrity, faith, obedience, and the knowledge that God has chosen YOU for His great move. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 14, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso.\n"
