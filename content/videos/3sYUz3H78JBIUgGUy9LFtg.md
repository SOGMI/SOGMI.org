description: "In Joshua 7, the sin of one man, Achan, caused Israel to incur losses. We cannot allow anyone who has been continually sinning to join the battle. God wants to move mightily here in the world, but the Body of Christ must become holy and blameless before God or else we will experience delays. The founding fathers of the United States are cheering us on now. We must continue to fight for this nation and obey God's ways of doing things in every area. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 06, 2020.\n"
