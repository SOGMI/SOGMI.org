description: "In Matthew 22:14 Jesus says, \"Many are called but few are chosen.\" and that is become only a few people decide to make themselves set apart and following God completely. When Daniel was called to be trained for the Babylonian palace there were 500-600 other boys drafted to be trained. However out of that group of hundreds only Daniel and three other Hebrew boys chose to make themselves set apart and committed to God. The others become comfortable and mixed into the Babylonian system. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 11, 2021."
