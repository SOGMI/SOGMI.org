description: "Pastor Josh opens up the first Wednesday of the year with putting a guard over our mouth. When you give your own opinion, you are limiting yourself and limiting God. In Matthew 22, the people that were invited to the banquet knew of the date, but they made their own excuses. Even some of the attendees didn't value the invitation. This represents the calling God has on our life and how we value it. Is your mindset going to be positive for what God has planned? Or complain about the inconveniences that come with following? We need to change our mindset and cut out the distractions that keep us from what God has planned. And as we follow through his steps, we will find joy in the work he has given us. We must learn to find joy in hearing from God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX. "
