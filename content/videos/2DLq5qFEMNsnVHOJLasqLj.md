description: "We must understand that just one Word from God is all it takes. It does not come about from our ability. It does not come about from our understanding. It has to come from God's ways of doing things. This is especially important for the Transfer of Wealth Influence and Affluence. Remember, God turned Saul from a nobody to a king in a day. It will be the same for us in this move of God. We have to see things in the spiritual realm and we have to think and operate according to the spiritual realm. When Goliath stood before the armies of Israel, everyone was focused on the physical. They saw how strong and imposing he was and they coward in fear, but David focused on the Spiritual realm. When speaking to Saul, David said the following, \"This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them (the slain lion and the bear) because he has defied the armies of the Living God.\" David was focused on God's promises and who God was. We must do the same in this season. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 18, 2022.\n"
