description: "Happy Christmas Eve!! Pastor Joshua shook us up as well as encouraged us. Though we may be nothing than a speck in the grand creation of our Father, He still looked at us with so much love. So much so that He chose to put Himself in our shoes and live as a man who would be scorned, beaten and crucified, all to save us from eternal damnation. That type of love is incomparable. Many of us Christians time and time again slip up in the same cycles without obedience, and yet our Father forgives us over and over as long as we ask. Is that being a good son and daughter in Christ? We know better, and yet we allow ourselves to be tempted with our own fleshly desires. It is time to push your obedience, to show our Father that we appreciate all that He has done for us. The year is not up, there is still time to improve, granted not much but plenty. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 24, 2023 by Pastor Joshua Sosso."
