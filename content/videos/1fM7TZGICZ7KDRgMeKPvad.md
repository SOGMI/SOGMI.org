description: "Pastor Mike came fired up tonight with revelation that he got from God about the key to the Kingdom of God. He shared a past vision the Lord had given him and how praying in the Spirit was the key of attaining the vision. He also shares a story about Oral Roberts and the university God gave him which he knew nothing about. When we aren't sure how to move forward on the next step, praying in the Spirit is the key."
