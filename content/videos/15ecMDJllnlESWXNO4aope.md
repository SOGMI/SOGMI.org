description: "Happy resurrection Sunday beautiful people! Today is a day of celebration of our Christ. Never forget the sacrifice our Father has made for us. Let it be a reminder of the love that our Father has for us. To keep us in line, to always strive to do God's will. This is not a ministry for us all, but a lifestyle. Our country is a reflection of the state of the body of Christ. Remember walk in the power of Christ with dignity, spread the truth about of King, we were placed here to rule and reign, we are the head of the nations, so thank Jesus for His defeat of the grave. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 31, 2024 By Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
