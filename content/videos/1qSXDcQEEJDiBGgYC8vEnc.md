description: "Pastor Josh came tonight with a powerful message that it is time to be set apart from the world. Being set apart requires us to have signs and wonders every day. We have to expect miracles in our life all the time. Miracles have to come forth before we can enter our promise land. God should be our first choice for our problems. The world is going to see such miraculous signs and wonders that they will say, \"It had to be God!\" This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
