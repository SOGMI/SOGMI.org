description: "The move of God in this nation must start with the Body of Christ! We cannot hold onto unforgiveness or bitterness. The move of God will continue to move onward and if we don't move forward it will pass us by, and if you're holding onto unforgiveness it will be a heavy burden that will hold you back. The Father God has given all authority to Jesus and Jesus turned around and gave it to us His Body. So transformation is coming to the nation, but it's gotta start with us. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 27, 2021."
