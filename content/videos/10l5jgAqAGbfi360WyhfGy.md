description: "Jesus told in Mark 14, \"And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.” So if Jesus said it, it must be true. We the Church are supposed to operate in miracles, signs, and wonders. Let us raise the standard concerning healing. However the healing power and anointing manifesting in your life depends on you. It is a personal decision. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 14, 2021."
