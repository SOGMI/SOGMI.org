description: "This evening message was a look into the details of Exodus 10, 11 and 12. The instructions given to Moses and the hardening of the Pharaoh's heart, give us a clear insight that sometimes the hardships that we go through, are for the benefit of God's people. Every step (plague) that was taken to show God's might and favor towards the Israelites was all being set for a greater purpose.\nIn the end the Israelites plundered the Egyptians. All the back and forth that the Pharaoh had done was all for the benefit of God's people. Pharaoh began bargaining with Moses, allowing him to take only the men and animals but to leave the women and children. This allows us to see that in our lives the enemy will allow us to have pieces of what God has promised us. Do not to be fooled, because they are only counterfeits. You are to be satisfied when you have fully been given everything that God has promised you. The subject of parental accountability was brought to our attention, many parents out there like to hand off their children to the elders or pastors of the church. By doing this, it is a clear indication that those parents do not believe in hell. After all if you took this matter serious, you would do everything in your power to correct you children. This move of God is moving quickly and it is an exciting time to be here with our Father. So lets strap in, follow these instructions and enjoy these victories. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church by Pastor Cristina Sosso."
