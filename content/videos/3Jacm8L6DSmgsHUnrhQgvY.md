description: "Tonight, we had the delight of hearing a wonderful sermon by Pastor Joshua Sosso. He discussed that the first step to wisdom is fear of the Lord. Talking to God should be second nature to us. We should begin everyday by changing our routine and let the Lord lead us. We must be weary of the praises of man because we can fall into the trap of pride. He also mentions about how God's timing is always perfect. Even if the idea is right, it might not be the right time according to God."
