description: "Have you ever asked where the power is in the Body of Christ? The reason why is because Christians are more interested in their own plans than God's plan. We must be disciplined enough to submit to God in everything. The manifestation of your glorious destiny doesn't depend on your pastor or any others in your life. It depends on whether you will make Jesus the Lord of your life each and every day or not. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 2, 2021."
