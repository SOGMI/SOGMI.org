description: "The law is exclusive. It limits people and creates regulations to where only select special groups of people can have authority. Many say how women cannot preach according to the law of God, but also ignore the fact that most men also cannot preach because they are not members of the tribe of Levi. This means that they are also automatically disqualified. However we do not live under the old covenant, Jesus brought us into the new covenant. We now operate under the Law of Love. Hebrews 7:17, \"For it is declared: 'You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.'\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 11, 2021.\n"
