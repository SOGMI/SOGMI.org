description: "If we want to be used mightily by God we have to live by faith. That means complete obedience to His instructions and not compromising in any area. It says in Hebrews 10:38 \"But my righteous one will live by faith and I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on June 13, 2021."
