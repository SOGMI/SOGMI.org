description: "Pastor Josh shared his story on trusting God with his life. He describes on what his plans were for his life by going to college and taking over the arts and entertainment. However, God had other plans for his career and how Pastor Josh is going to be a part of the arts and entertainment. Now, because Pastor Josh focused on God and obeyed him, God has provided everything he needs. God can do the exact same thing for us. Instead of focusing on the small problems we are facing, we need to obey God and focus on his plans. Like Pastor Josh mentions, most Christians don't want to follow God because they feel like they will miss out on current opportunities. God's plan is much greater than what we can imagine and when we obey him, he will provide everything we need. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
