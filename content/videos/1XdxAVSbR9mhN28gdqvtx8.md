description: "It says in Psalm 50:15 \"Make thankfulness your sacrifice to God, and keep the vows you made to the Most High. Then call on me when you are in trouble, and I will rescue you, and you will give me glory.\" God loves obedience more than sacrifices. We can shower Him with love by obeying Him and showing gratitude to Him. We should desire that calls us \"one after His own heart\" just like He called David. \"I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.\" Acts 13:22 (NKJV) This sermon was delivered by Deborah Ferrel at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 24, 2021.\n"
