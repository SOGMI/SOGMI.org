description: "Pastor Cris and Pastor Josh both talk about what to do when believing for a miracle. If we are looking for a financial miracle, pray for other's financial miracles so we can plant seeds in the same area we need help. Pastor Josh also talks about us ruling over different industries in the world like kings. He also talks about how being led by God allows us to play by a different set of rules than the ones of the world."
