description: "Pastor Josh focused heavily on the moving of God that is coming very soon and getting prepared for it. The blessings God has promised us are a responsibility God gives us to see if we will obey. God can't use us in the miraculous if we don't obey him in our everyday lives. Our relationship with God will determine how everything manifests in our lives. Take time to grow your relationship with God so you can experience the supernatural!"
