description: "A question was posed at the beginning of this service, can a Christian be possessed? The answer is yes. Once we have acknowledge this truth we can begin to look within ourselves and start to remove these demons that have been barrowed into our bodies. Some of these devils have been apart of our lives for many many years. This is God's mercy that He is giving us this time to correct our sins before it is too late for us. this is the time to longer look back, to break away from these possessions that have been holding us back. Addictions such as drugs and pornography are demons that have been latched to many Christians. These spirits are demonic and nasty spirits. Jesus said these types of spirits can only be cast out by fasting and prayer. Many of us need to heed to this warning from our Father because it will be brought to the light if we do not take this serious. How are we going to free others from captivity if we ourselves are captives? We have been called to free the captives, so we must go into our prayer closets and ask our Father for help, ask Him for the steps to take, what to do to break these chains. Once again heed this warning because God will break you or you will be exposed. Keep your opinions to yourself! Time and time again we have been told this, but have we been obeying this command? or are we giving power to these words? In every instruction you hear, you need to put them to the litmus test, don't just assume you are hearing the voice of God. Test it! We will not be used by God if we are not freed from these spirits, for our safety and for others. The time is now, so lets make these corrections before it is too late. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July, 30 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso "
