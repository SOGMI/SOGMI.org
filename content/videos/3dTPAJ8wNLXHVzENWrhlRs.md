description: "Pastor Joshua has given us a recap and expanded on the word that was given last Wednesday by Pastor Cristina. Prophecies are for today. God has said that every word He has given us is going to come to pass. So that means for us children of God we should be rejoicing! Our mindsets need to be switched to that of kings and priest for our Lord. For the wicked who are knowingly living outside of God's will should be shaking in their shoes. Make corrections prepare for the move our Father is bringing, so that when He arrives we will not be found wanting, but will be able to take part in His grand plan. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 20, 2023 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n"
