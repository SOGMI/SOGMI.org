description: "God has given us promises and instructions for our lives and the nations and Pastor Cris gave us a new outlook on how to view them. She continuously told us to be fully persuaded in the promises of God. Like how God promised to use back doors to turn our country to righteousness, we have seen righteous transformations on the state level. This is one example that we have to be fully persuaded to what God says. If he tells us an instruction or promise, we have to believe it in our hearts that what he says is the outcome we will see. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
