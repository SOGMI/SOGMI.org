description: "In a continuation from our morning sermon from Pastor Cris, Pastor Josh pounded the idea that time is of the essence to follow God. We should treat this time as our last chance to have God use us in this time. When God gives us a prophecy or instructions, we have to walk our faith and put in the work wherever we are. Pastor Josh mentions Joseph and how he worked hard when he was in the jail, so God was able to raise him up when he got out. Pastor Josh also talks about Elisha and how he believed the word of God that he received Elijah's spirit. He believed the word of God and other prophets didn't believe the words spoken through them! God is using this time to prove us to see if we take hold of the opportunity and not let it go. No matter what instructions you receive, don't look at the outcome in your mind. Allow God to prove you in those situations and you will see the supernatural in your life. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
