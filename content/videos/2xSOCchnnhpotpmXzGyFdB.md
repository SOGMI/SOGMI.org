description: "Abide in Christ Jesus and He will abide in you. As it says in John 15:5 \"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.\" We need to abide in Christ Jesus to be made ready to be fruitful for the transfer of wealth. In addition to this, Christians need to stop looking for favors in everything. We need to focus on being a blessing to others, for this is the reason that God is calling us to the transfer of wealth influence and affluence."
