description: "This evening sermon focused on the type of faith that is needed in this times. Each and everyone of us has been given a calling by our Father, so clearly we did not make the choice ourselves to be used in all the ways our Father has told us. That means that we can no longer move to our assumptions. In every opportunity that is brought to our feet, we should be presenting those opportunities to our Father for further instructions. Now these manifestations and calling come with our obedience to allow the Holy Spirit to transform us and even rearrange our schedule. Our Father has given us these wonderful callings, so when things do not go as planned you have to have the faith to trust that our Father has our backs afterall it was His idea. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March, 03, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso "
