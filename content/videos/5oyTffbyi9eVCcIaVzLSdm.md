description: "This evening, Pastor Cris continued on the theme of breaking away by following the Holy Spirit in every sector of life. She references Moses in the book of Exodus and how he trusted God the first time when God instructed him to strike the rock. But when Moses didn't listen the second time, he lost his chance to break away and lead the Israelites to the promise land. God gives you simple instructions that you can follow, but he won't tell you the details. God wants you to trust him wholeheartedly and be totally dependent on him. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
