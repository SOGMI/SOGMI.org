description: "There was a whole prophetic fabric that for told of the Birth of the Messiah. This included things that were impossible. For example: He had to be born of a Virgin. The Husband of the Virgin would have to be excepting. He had to be born in Bethlehem. He had to be a part of the line of David. Despite all of that, God orchestrated everything into its proper place. We as Christians are committed by God to put these things in remembrance. We are to remember His Glory and the good things He has done. Including sending His only Son. this message was delivered by Paula Nations at Freedom Fellowship Chruch International on December 26, 2021. \n"
