description: "This Father's day it's important to remember that the Father God is the perfect father for us. In all that we do we must submit and honor Him. Jesus says in John 14:23-24 “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 20, 2021.\n"
