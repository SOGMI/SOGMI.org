description: "Have we been keeping God on a schedule? Has all the business of our live and responsibility become priority in our day to day? Now is not the time to have our Father on any type of schedule, instead the schedule should be moved around Him. How many times have we missed a move of God because we were to caught up with what is going on in our lives? Once you make the decision to be lead by the Holy Spirit, you must continue to be sensitive to His leading, if you do not you will slowly begin to slip back into your old ways, which will ultimately lead to missed opportunities. Once we have been given the transfer and wealth, influence and affluence, we will be able to implement change to all we have under our influence. With that comes the responsibility of correcting even your family, no one gets a pass. Are you willing to give up everything for the will of God? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 24, 2023 by Pastor Joshua Sosso."
