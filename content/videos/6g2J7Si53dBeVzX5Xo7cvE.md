description: "Pastor Josh shared with us plenty of stories throughout the Bible where people were led by the Spirit of God. David was still Saul's servant, but he was led by the Spirit in every part of his life. Daniel was intelligent to solve problems and interpret dreams that no one else could understand. The common thing is that they were all led by the Spirit of God. God wants us to pursue his Spirit and use the greatest gift in the world.\n"
