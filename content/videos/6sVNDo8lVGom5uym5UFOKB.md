description: "In this message, Pastor Cristina urges us to focus on the vision God has given us. Just like in II Chronicles when God gave David the exact instructions and specifications for the temple of the Lord, God will also give us the precise blueprints for what He has called us to do. And just like with David and the temple, the vision is being passed down to the next generation to finish. Do not dwell on the mistakes of the past, but do whatever you have been given now in complete excellence, no matter how small the task. Let us delay no longer! Let us focus on the vision of God! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX  by Pastor Cristina Sosso on August 6, 2023."
