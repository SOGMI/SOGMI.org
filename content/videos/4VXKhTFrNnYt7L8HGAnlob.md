description: "Soldiers are trained and disciplined to always follow the instructions of their Commanding Officer. If the soldier does what he wants over the task at hand, he is considered AWOL. Defying orders can lead to serious repercussions. In the Church, many Christians lack discipline when following the instructions of God. They focus more on what they want to do and act on the advice of others over the instructions of God. We are in spiritual warfare right now and the transfer of wealth is a mission in that war, so we need to treat it with the same discipline that a soldier would. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 9th, 2022."
