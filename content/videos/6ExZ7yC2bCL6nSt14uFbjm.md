description: "Pastor Mike was reviewing his notes from the Prophetic Gathering of the Saints and really focused on getting rid of the little foxes that are holding us back from our blessings. God has so much coming in 2024 and we don't want to miss it. So if there are areas of your life that you know you get distracted in, it is time to get right for the blessing of God. He also mentions that when God gives you a word or instruction, you need to drop whatever and do it. What God has spoken will come to pass, with or without us. Don't be a spectator in 2024 and get ready for the expansion that is coming. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
