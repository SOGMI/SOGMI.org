description: "John 1:5 states, \"The light shines in the darkness and the darkness can never extinguish it\". This means that no matter what the light will always prevail. However if the light isn't shining then we have to ask why? Since the darkness cannot extinguish the light that means that we the Body of Christ had something to do with it. It means that we aren't shining the light of Christ like we should. We, the Church, have a responsibility to represent the Kingdom of God in power, authority, and love. Blessing, manifestations, signs, and wonders should follow us each and every day. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church on February 02, 2021.\n"
