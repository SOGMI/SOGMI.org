description: "It's time for Christians to go all in concerning our relationship with God. One of the major things that prevents manifestations from happening in the Church is that Christians try to fit the move of God into their schedule and into their way of thinking. God's instructions are often inconvenient and they go against conventional ways of thinking. If we try to force our own opinions then God will resist us. The manifestation of the move of God and the transfer of wealth influence and affluence depends on your willingness to cooperate with God and allowing Him to rearrange your schedule. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 4, 2021."
