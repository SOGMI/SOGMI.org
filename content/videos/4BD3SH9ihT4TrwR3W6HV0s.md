description: "This morning Pastor Cristina reminded us that we have to see God as sovereign. We have to look to our Father in heaven for our guidance. Too often we the body of Christ look to the worlds way of advancing in our lives. We seek out the advice of those who only have knowledge of the worlds ways of advancing. Are we willing to seek out God in our lives by pulling ourselves away from all the worries of the world? Set time about for God. If we truly want what God has in store for us, we would meditate on his words and prophecies day and night, like a child excited for a trip.\nOnce we get a taste of God's glory, that is all that you would want. Even though there will be times of distractions we will always run back to God's glory. Our responsibility as Christ followers are to be prepared for anything, in this way we will be able to be a blessings to others. Our time, money, and resources could all be saved if we just ask the Father first, before we make our own decisions.\nIf you're going through your day to day lives without including God you are on the wrong track. Including God in your day to day lives would be a blessing to you and everyone around you. It will give glory to God as well because those around you will see the light in you pointing right back at the Father. So give thanks to the Father because even in your turmoil Gods plan for you is greater if you are seeking the ways of God. We don't know Gods plans for us, all we need to now is our Father is sovereign. \n"
