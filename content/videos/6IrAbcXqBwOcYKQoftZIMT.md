description: "Pastor Cristina Sosso gave a powerful sermon this morning, reminding us what we are called to do in God's kingdom. Some of us have forgotten the words that our Father has given us pertaining to the works of the world, we are not to engage in the ways of the world, nor are we supposed to react to the wicked things they do. We are in a spiritual battle and we can not be idle. You are to hold your tongue when it pertains to other followers, you are not more righteous than anybody else. Most importantly keep your opinions to yourself! This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 23, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso."
