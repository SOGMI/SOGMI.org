description: "On this Resurrection Sunday, Pastor Cris Sosso discusses how God intends to bring a move the likes of which the Church has never seen before. He intends to transfer resources, influence, and affluence to His Church so that we can transform the world. However, this move will not happen if we try to do it in our own understanding. It is too big for us to do alone. We have to let God lead. God's plan for you is so big - much bigger than you can even imagine, and you will be able to step into it by relying on the Holy Spirit. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 17, 2022."
