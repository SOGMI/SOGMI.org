description: "This Morning Pastor Cristina gave a powerful message about or qualifications of spreading the gospel. Turns out we have no excuses, no age, gender, education, or where we grew up disqualifies us from The Great Commission. We need to come to terms with ourselves that our God is sovereign.\nWhy do we continue to pay attention to the bad news network? Why aren't we pushing back on this worlds system? Everyone of us believers are anointed to do all things through Christ, if you are not anointed, you are not a believer. So stop holding yourself back by saying \"I don't have the anointing.\"\nJohn 14:15 If you love me, keep my commands. Remember God is sovereign over our lives because we are bought with a price. Take no information to the heart if you have not ran it by the great physician the Lord our God. Its time to stop balancing between two systems; The worlds system and Gods' system.  Those to systems will never mix. It is time for our restoration. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
