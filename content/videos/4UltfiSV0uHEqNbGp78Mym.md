description: "We heard a powerful sermon from Paula Nations this evening about entering the promise by entering the rest. She mentions Israel and how they missed out on the promise land because they refused to transform and enter into God's rest. Even though God told them it was their land, they looked at the situation in the natural and their unbelief caused disobedience. She also said that every instruction has a victory. If we truly believed what God was promising us, we would hold fast to the instruction and not let it go. When we get out of our own way and enter God's rest, that is when we can get our promises. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
