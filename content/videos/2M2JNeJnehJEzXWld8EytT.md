description: "Pastor Cris harps on the truth that our identity is in Christ. We cannot look back and use the excuses of our past mistakes any longer. If we truly believe that God has forgiven our past, we cannot focus on the past anymore, but continue to move forward on God's word. But when our identity changes, out mind has to change as well. Do not listen to other opinions or let others limit you. God can give you a double portion wherever you are in your life. Let him take control. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
