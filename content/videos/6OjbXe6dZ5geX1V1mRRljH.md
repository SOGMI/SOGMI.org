description: "This evening Ms. Deborah Ferrel talked about our identity in Christ. We live in a dark world, but we must remember that *we* are the light, so we should not get distracted by the bad news but focus on being the solution. In Christ we will find our true identity and calling, so it is Christ and His word that we should focus on. In Christ we are called to be kings and priests so we should make sure our mindset aligns with that. We cannot have the same mindset as the world, for it is in Christ alone that we can reach our destiny. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 8, 2024 by Deborah Ferrel. \n"
