description: "It is time for the Body of Christ to step into action because He has told us that He us opening up golden opportunities. His people are supposed to be the best example of how to implement God's system and His ways of doing things here on Earth. When God's will becomes our number one priority, we don't have to worry. Seek first the Kingdom of God above all else, and He will give you everything you need. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 20, 2020."
