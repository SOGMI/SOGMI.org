description: "We have finally made it to Pentecost Sunday! As we have heard from Pastor Cris and Pastor Josh, we have reached a turning point in our lives. God has seen all of the acts that we have done and is pleased with us. As Pastor Cris says, we can ask God for anything in our lives. Since we are so close to the Transfer of Wealth, we have to allow God to dictate all of our actions. Now that we are at a turning point, it is time to close all the doors to the past and look forward to the bright future being led by God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
