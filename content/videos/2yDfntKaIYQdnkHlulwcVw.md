description: "This evenings was a very short but powerful message of being faithful in all the instructions we have been given, taking initiative, and hardworking in all that we are given. In our jobs, our homes, in our family. Always be aware that even when we do not know it, we are being watched by our Father in heaven. Stay faithful. If you feel you are being wrong, that is not an exception to start trying to take what you believe you are owed. The prophecies we have been given will not bloom if we do not put forth action. Remember we can not even fathom all the things our Father has in store for us, our heads will explode. So let us all explode with excitement because big things are happening, blessings are coming, and victory is inevitable. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on June 28, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
