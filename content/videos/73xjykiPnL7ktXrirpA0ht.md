description: "Have you been keeping your word to our Father? Did you follow instructions and renew your covenant with our Father? Have you forgotten what you have said to Him? Tonight those of us who have fallen of short of keeping our word, have been spiritually whipped. Pastor Cristina has reminded us that we have been held to a higher standard when it comes to the covenant we have made. Scriptures give several examples of the importance of keeping our words, psalms 50:14, 66:13, 62:7, Proverbs 20:25, and 1 Corinthians 6:20. Even though we have been scolded tonight, we must not forget that we can not be separated from God's love. He is a sovereign God, whos mercy and patience is great. Now is the time to get yourself back on track, ask the Lord for correction, renew your promises, and thank the Lord for His goodness and grace. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International, on May 10, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso. "
