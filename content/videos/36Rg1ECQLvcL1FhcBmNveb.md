description: "We have received a call to Holiness here and now. Everyday we should be taking every moment alone to speak and listen to our Father. We can no longer get caught up in our own little world and postpone the instructions we have been given. For every instruction given that still has not manifested due to our disobedience, we should be embarrassed. All it takes is little obedience's that could drastically change your lives. God has told us that there will be no more delays, His move is coming whether we are ready or not. When instructions are followed, blessing are in tow. Rejoice the time is now for our blessings and manifestations. Are you falling in line, or falling out? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 14, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso  "
