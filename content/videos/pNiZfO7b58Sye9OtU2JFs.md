description: "We were blessed to hear from James as he discussed the backstory of the Passover and the significance of different parts of the ceremony. From the 4 cups to the 3 breads, each step has specifics that are crucial even to this day. The Passover is significant to the breakthrough that we will experience in our lives. We encourage you to celebrate Passover in this season to see the breakthrough come forth! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.  "
