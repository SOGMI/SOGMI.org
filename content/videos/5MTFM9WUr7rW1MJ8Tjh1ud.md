description: "Pastor Josh stresses the importance of not focusing on what's in the past, but to move forwards and upwards. Even though we might have previous revelation from God, we need to make sure that is in line to what God is doing now. God might have new manna for the time that we are in. We need to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit during this time and start putting things into action. We are at a turning point in history and there are great things about to happen in our country and in the world! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
