description: "Pastor Josh used multiple stories from the Bible to remind us of how to prepare for battles that are coming. He talks about Jehoshaphat and how he followed the Lord's instructions to praise not knowing the outcome. Then the Lord had their enemies defeated while they were praising. He also references the story of Esther and how God honored Mordecai when he didn't know of the plans of people trying to kill him. God is setting the stage for us to take over; all we have to do is go all in with him and praise him. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
