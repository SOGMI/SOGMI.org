description: "In Psalm 138:8 (ESV) David writes, \"The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your steadfast love, O Lord, endures forever.\" These are the words that God is now speaking over us and this nation. God will fulfill his purpose concerning you and He will fulfill his purpose concerning the United States of America. It is for this reason we must submit ourselves to his discipline and his teaching. In Ezekiel 12:28 it says, \"Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Sovereign Lord.'\". This great move of God is coming soon and it's not going to be delayed. We must make ourselves ready so that we can partake in what the Lord is preparing to do! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on August 16, 2023."
