description: "This evening Deborah Ferrel reminded us of the covenants made by our founding fathers starting in 1607 with the first group from England that touched down in Americas. Again in 1789 George Washington dedicated the United States to our Father once again. We are a blessed nations because of our founding fathers, and our Father does not forget about those covenants. Be thankful for our fathers covenants to us that as long as we seek Him out He will be found, if we ask Him for something he will answer. He has given us His protection, and success in His name. Proverbs 19:23 says if we are sold out for Jesus we will have protection, abundant life and complete satisfaction. Let's have a blessed Thanksgiving and let us not forget to Thank our heavenly Father for all that He has done for us. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 22, 2023 by Deborah Ferrel.  \n"
