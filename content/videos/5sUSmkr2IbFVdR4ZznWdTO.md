description: "This evening Pastor Josh discusses how we must strive to do God's will in every area of our lives. Being a student of the word of God isn't enough. We need to be a student of the Holy Spirit in order to read the Bible correctly. This is how we are going to get new revelations. Otherwise, we are just reading another book. God takes imperfect people and God revises them. We need to get out of our selfish needs, but we need to do what God wants. Stop trying to fit God in a box. We have to die to ourselves daily in order to do this. If God isn't in your plans or designs, it's in the world's system. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
