description: "God's ways of doing things will lead us down a way we have been before, and it will always be greater than anything we have envisioned for ourselves. Abraham's actions altered the course of history because he obeyed God. Think about a version of him where he didn't obey God versus who we know him to be. There is a great dichotomy between what we want and what God wants for our life. Don't let yourself be your biggest stumbling block. God is training us to be revolutionaries. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 25, 2021."
