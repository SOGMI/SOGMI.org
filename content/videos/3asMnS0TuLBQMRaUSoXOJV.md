description: "Goliath may have been a physical giant, but David was a giant in the spirit. Pastor Josh encourages the Body of Christ to remember the promises of God because as David said in 1 Samuel 17, the battle is the Lord's and He will deliver victory into the hands of His people. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 11, 2020."
