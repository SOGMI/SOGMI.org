description: "We are already in a period of acceleration and manifestation. Focus on your instructions and focus on what God is having you do right now. In addition, God has a specific instruction for us which is be careful of how you use the power and authority given to you, especially when you are offended or you aren't getting what you want. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 28, 2020."
