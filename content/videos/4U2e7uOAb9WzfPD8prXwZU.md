description: "It's Pentecost Sunday! This is a season of supernatural and miraculous. God is ready to move mightily so it's time for the Body of Christ to step into its position. Stop listening to the bad news - God did not give us a spirit of fear. Instead focus on God, hearing from God, and obeying God. The revelations, business plans, and heavenly understand will come suddenly if we focus on hearing from God and submitting to Him. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 23, 2021."
