description: "We are being held back from our full potential due to our own selfishness and pride.  God's power and blessings are putting us in these great positions not our own abilities.  Getting out of our own way and yielding to the Holy Spirit will allow Him to guide us and lead us to our full potential. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship International  on September 13, 2023"
