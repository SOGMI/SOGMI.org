description: "Are we staying in line with the Lords instructions and covenant? It's a simple instruction but proves to be difficult due to our own fleshly desires. Nothing removes us from the covering and blessings but ourselves. Our Father gives us instructions to follow to the letter and when we deviate from those instructions we allow the enemy to access you and begin to pull you back into the world. Sometimes when we are given instructions that we don't agree with because it doesn't fit into our desires, it is important that you do not persist in your way because eventually God will give you over to your desires that could ultimately cause you to lose your covering. Now we are all one body, given instructions, if any one of us choose to not follow those instructions it could cause a delay in the whole body. Our Father has so many blessings and wonderful things for us if we just follow His commands. The time is now. No more time to waste. Time to obey. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 27, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso\n\nyour own faith and obedience is the only thing to get in your way of blessings and victories\nyou need to be aware of what is going on around you and in your country, don't take anything at face value, you have to ask the Holy Spirit where to direct you attention\neverything is spiritual\nbecause of sin in your camp there could be delays, ask the Holy Spirit to expose those wrong doers in your camp\njust because you study the scriptures does not mean you know the truth, you have to study the scriptures\nthe only way that satan gains control over you is when you step out the will of God\nsome off us get instructions and still try to get there way n\nknowing the Father said no\nreckless path when you assist on your own way"
