description: "We heard a great message from Drew and Deborah Ferrel this evening. Drew shared with us some ways to reset our daily life, like keeping scriptures in front of our eyes and speaking positive words. Deborah shared with us the reset that is coming to the body of Christ. We will be at the helm in all areas of society, like government and media. We are called to dispossess the nations of this word and it all starts with obedience of God. We all need to develop our relationship with God on a deeper level to bring forth signs and wonders. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church in San Antonio, TX."
