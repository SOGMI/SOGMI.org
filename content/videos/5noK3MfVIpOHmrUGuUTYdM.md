description: "Many in the Body of Christ are wondering why the desires of their heart haven't manifested, or why it seems like they are stuck even though they are serving God. The reason why is because they have been imprisoned - by offenses, religiosity, unforgiveness, and others. If you've been going in circles and haven't been able to get out you are imprisoned and that is the reason that God cannot move in your life. Our doctrines and traditions are limiting people. Remember not to focus on yourself - your wants and your desires - but instead focus on God and what he is calling you to do. This is a reset time for the Body of Christ. Focus on God and you will be able to break free from that prison that has been holding you back. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 28, 2021. "
