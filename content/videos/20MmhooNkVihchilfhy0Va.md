description: "Pastor Josh talked about being a problem solver and manager in all aspects of life. Like Moses did in Exodus, he appointed people to solve smaller problems, while he handled bigger problems. We have to find people that we can trust to carry out the vision that God gives us. We cannot handle every detail. Pastor Josh also gave us some insight on how on a film set, there are different departments that have to work together to solve one problem."
