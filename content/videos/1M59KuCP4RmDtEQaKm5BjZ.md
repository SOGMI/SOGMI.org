description: "We are ambassadors of Christ, remember Jesus did not come to the world to establish a religion but to establish the kingdom of God. He gave us the keys to open up the kingdom, to be able to transform the world around us. If he is the vine and we are the branches, (John 15:5) how are we to do anything with him? We will only welt and crumble away. You may think you are not qualified to bring the kingdom down because of pass transgression nut if you repent and ask for forgiveness our Father wipes those sins away. Through Christ we are the sap of our God, we can be used to transfer God's love simply through touch. So lets go out there spread God's love through being examples of Christ, renewal our minds continually by diving into God's world and transform the world around us. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church on February 19, 2023 by Pastor Mike Sosso."
