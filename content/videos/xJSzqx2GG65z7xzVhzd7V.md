description: "In Romans 5, Paul explains how through one man, Adam, sin and death entered the world, and through one man, Jesus, the gift of life and salvation was brought to us. Because of this, we are not justified by the law but by grace through Jesus Christ. Paul explains this in Galatians 2:16 saying, \"know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.\" Unfortunately despite all of this many spiritual leaders have been trying to bring the Church back  under the law, because this puts them in control and makes them \"special\". This is both dangerous and against the will of God. If we want to be used mightily by God is this move, we have to law aside these doctrines and law aside any privileged mentality. God will give influence and affluence to anyone who seeks to limit God's people or make a name for themselves. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on October 30, 2022."
