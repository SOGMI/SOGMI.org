description: "Get out of your religiosity. Watch out for those who steer Godly conversations over to themselves, it is demonic behavior. Most importantly be mindful of yourselves. As far as our Father is concerned there are only two time clocks. One the body of Christ stepping into their positions, and two Israel turning there eyes to the Father. We should all be addiment on producing a reliable generation fit to push this world into Christ culture. The time for sitting back is gone. We are kings and priest, here to bring God's kingdom down on Earth. We are greater now through Christ death, we have the ministry of reconciliation. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 07, 2024 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
