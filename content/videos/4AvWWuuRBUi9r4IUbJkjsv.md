description: "\nThis evening, Pastor Joshua talks about how we aren't being sent to the nations to become rich and live comfy, but to be a blessing to others and spread the good name of God. We must do the things that we don't want to do to prove that we are trustworthy to be part of the Transfer of Wealth. Will you prioritize what you want or what God wants? When we do things our own way, we are limiting God. Our needs will be met after God's will is done. We have to be prayed up before we act on anything in our life. We have to persevere like Joseph or Abraham. Don't be concerned about what others say or think, but what God thinks. Preservering is a must in this time! This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
