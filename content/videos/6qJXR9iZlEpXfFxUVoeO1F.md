description: "Many Christians' perception of faith is that it's this magic thing that will produce riches, blessings, and the like. In many ways, it tends to become a \"get rich quick\" mentality. In order for us to reach what God has for us, we need to go through a transition period where we act in Faith. David was not immediately King over Israel after being anointed by Samuel. Joseph was a slave, servant, and a prisoner before he became 2nd to the Pharaoh over Egypt. Nonetheless, Both walked out their faith in the promise of God and acted on it. If we are to become Kings and Priests here on earth, we must first be faithful with what God has given us right now. If we continue to do things as we are now, we cannot take hold of the transfer of wealth. This sermon was delivered August 8, 2024 at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Cris Sosso."
