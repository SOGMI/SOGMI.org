description: "This evening, we heard from the group that went to Chicago and how the Lord guided their steps to decree over the country. We need to pray in the spirit when we have no idea what to do and need to be persistent in our faith. Pastor Josh shared the parable of the wealthy young man in Matthew 19. Jesus said he had to leave all his wealth to find eternal life. Not only do we need to be willing to give up wealth, but we need to give every other area of life. When we get to heaven, nobody will be standing with us before God, so we need to lay everything down and walk in faith. We need to put complete trust in God because his way is better than anything we could do for ourselves. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
