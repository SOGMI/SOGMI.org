description: "The spiritual earthquakes have been rumbling, manifestation, replacements and promotions are peculating in the spiritual realm as well as the natural. It is an exciting time to follow the instructions given, but also a time where no time needs to be wasted. We are in preparation and the instructions are vital. Don't ever think that you know what plans have been prepared for you, or that your calling is by your own idea. Keep in mind that your preparations are also heart issues that need to be addressed. God is a God of mercy and grace so if you happen to miss the first train to God's move, repent and quickly catch the next train because it will not wait. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 19, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
