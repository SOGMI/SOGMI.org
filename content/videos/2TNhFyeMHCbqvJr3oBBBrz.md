description: "Pastor Cris focuses tonight on remaining positive despite the negative we see. She reminds to not be alarmed with what is going on in the world. Instead of focusing on the problems, we need to ask God for the solution. Pastor Cris gives the example that if we are expecting inflation, we should ask God what steps we need to take to prepare for it. Never panic for any situation that is coming. We need to rejoice because God is rejoicing in the heavens. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
