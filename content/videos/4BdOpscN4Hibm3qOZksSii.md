description: "The odds may seem impossible. The situation in the natural may make you feel down, but remember discouragement is a sin of unbelief, because it is telling God that we don't believe in His Word. God has already spoken what He plans to bring to pass in the United States of America. You need to decide whether you are going to believe Him or not. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 12, 2020."
