description: "This morning's service focused on God's Kingdom and how we are to hone in on our own purpose for in it. It is only when God's body realize their purpose in the Kingdom, will Christ returns. We work for money day after day, when in fact money should be working for us. Where is our authority? Do you fear the prince of darkness? Why? Do you not know that we out rank him? We are joined heirs of Christ, kings and priest under the name of Jesus. We are all part of the royal family. Competition within the body of Christ is useless and causes you to lose focus on the task ahead. Ask the Holy Spirit who you are, what your purpose if for His Kingdom. Understand your authority in Christ, and the devils will also recognize it too. Have we not been told that we have the authority in heaven and here on earth? The enemy has already lost, he just refuses to accept it. Wake up every morning and ask our Father what we are to do for that day? For those who oppose our Father they have Psalms 2 coming to them. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 16, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
