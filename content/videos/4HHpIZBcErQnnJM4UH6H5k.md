description: "Is God front and center of your life? Are you scheduling your day to day properly? Many of us don't allow our time to be spent with our Father before we do what we want. We lack the trust in our Father to know that He has the best interest for us. We have forgotten that He is our First love, we have allowed ourselves to be distracted by our own desires. Time is of the essence, we can not allow ourselves to be disqualified by our mummering, just like the generation that followed Moses. Our Father sees us as thoe in Numbers 14:11. An ungrateful child when we mummer and question His instructions. Now is the time to decide if you are going to follow the instructions to the letter or are you going to turn back to your fleshy way of living. When the instructions we are given are followed the blessing that we are given will carry on to those after us creating generational wealth. God has great things in store for us but will we stop our complaining? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 06, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
