description: "The move of God is coming mightily. This means His holiness will be made manifest and the wicked will be dealt with. That means even those within the Church will not be spared. You need to confront the sin in your own life and become holy and blameless like God. We cannot continue compromising in this season, because if you keep compromising how can God trust you to implement His ways of doing things when you have riches and influence? The move is here! Satan knows he's running out of time which is why He tries to infiltrate the Church and slow things down as much as He can. When it comes to our doctrines and traditions we have to allow the Holy Spirit to move freely or we will stifle God's move in our lives. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 02, 2021."
