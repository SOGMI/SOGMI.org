description: "This week Pastor Cris emphasizes the importance of circumcising our hearts. It says in Romans 2:28 that circumcision is not merely outward or physical. Everything is spiritual first. In Acts 7:51 Stephen addressed the pharisees saying \"You stiff necked people! Your hearts and ear are still uncircumcised you are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!\" So, this is the reason why we need to do this in our own lives, because if we don't circumcise our hearts, we will become stiff necked and resist the Holy Spirit. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on February 20, 2022.\n"
