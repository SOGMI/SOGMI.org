description: "A very exciting service this evening with Mr. Ed Grubb and Ms. Deborah Ferrel about signs and wonders and a consistent walk with Christ. Remember, it has be told time and time again, that signs and wonders follow those who believe. The work does not stop there. Just because you are saved does not mean you are finished pushing forward. There are still those out there that do not know Christ and as believers we are responsible for the people God puts in our life to save. One of the best things we can tell ourselves and others is that we are God's special treasure. So it's time to start sharing how special we are to God. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
