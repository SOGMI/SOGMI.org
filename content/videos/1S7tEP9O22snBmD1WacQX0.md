description: "Pastor Josh spoke tonight of encouragement and how now is the time to uplift our fellow Kings and Priests. Pastor Josh spoke of Joshua and how God reminded him that no one will stand in his way of victory. After hearing these words of encouragement from the Lord, Joshua and his men gave praise throughout the night and straight into battle because it was clear that the battle was not his but the Lord. Knowing all this, what is keeping us from moving forward and tearing down these giants in our lives and the world? "
