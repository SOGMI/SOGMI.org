description: "The Great move of God has started and disobedience will delay His great mov. Becuase of this Christians need to not be quick to give their own opnions. We see in the scriptures how God is able to transform the outcomes in a instant. Isaiah 58:11-14  tells us that if we obey the Lord and are careful not to go our own way or speak idle words, then we will rebuild the ancient ruins and we will find joy in the Lord and ride in victory. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 02, 2023\n"
