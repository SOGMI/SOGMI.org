description: "What instructions are you following? Whos pattern are you using to achieve your goals? Are you taking the time to pray and ask our Father for direction? Are you trying to build on a foundation of you own works? You must make it a point to come to the Father for every move and decision you make. Prayer is the most powerful weapon we have against the enemy. Our army is far greater than any other military combined. You want to defeat the enemy? Get on you knees and pray to the Father, ask Him for direction, which way to go. Stop boasting about all the good that you have done. You are suppose to be good, that's like bragging about feeding your children when they are hungry. Be bold, if you see something or someone out of line with the will of God, correct them, but not before you first consult the Father. Your schedule should not be planned out without first asking God for guidance. Just like at a job, you are given a set of instructions to follow, if you do not follow those instructions given you will be fired. If you are a supervisor or manager you still have someone to report to. Our Father is our CEO, He knows best for us and His people. The transfer of wealth and influence is not for the faint of heart. You will be tested and your heart issues will be brought to you attention. Will you correct them? Or will you blame others for your own short comings? This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 3, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso. \n"
