description: "This evening, Pastor Joshua Sosso discusses how our love relationship with God is the most important relationship. We need to show love to God just as if he is our spouse. You wouldn't ignore your spouse, which means we can't ignore God. We need to always have an open ear to the Holy Spirit and our heart needs to be pure. When God draws near to you, draw near to him. God is wanting to establish us. Just like the story of Jeroboam, don't sin or our life will be ruined with only a tiny mistake. If we love him, why would we purposely sin? This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
