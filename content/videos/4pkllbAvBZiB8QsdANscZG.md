description: "Pastor Joshua reminds us of the conditions we have been given by the Lord to bring His move here on the earth. Every instruction we have been given needs to be done to the letter. We have to present ourselves as holy, we have to be cleansing ourselves to be presented before our Father. It is only when we have all have obeyed these instructions that the transfer of wealth and influence as well as the political realm will come to pass and order. We shouldn't get all caught up in the past way of things being done. Our Father has very unique ways of doing things, just like Jesus using spit to open the eyes of the blind, or Moses striking a rock for water. You never know what the Father will ask you to do but His will be done if you follow those directions. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church on July 7, 2024 by Pastor Joshua Sosso.\n"
