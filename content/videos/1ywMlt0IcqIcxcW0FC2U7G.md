description: "Pastor Josh spoke this evening on the spirit of unity in the church and how that can bring forth manifestations. He talks about the 12 spies in Numbers and how the Lord told them the land was for them. Despite the word of the Lord, 10 of the spies didn't believe they could take the land due to what they saw in the natural. Since they weren't in unity, the Israelites were not able to enter into the promise land. In order to see the manifestations on Pentecost, we have to be in one accord as the body of Christ. Our focus needs to be on the vision of God to be in unity in order to see manifestations. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
