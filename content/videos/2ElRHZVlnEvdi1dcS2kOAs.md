description: "Power pact message addressing the continuous rise and fall of ourselves through familiar spirits. How many times have we conquered a sin that has been burdening us, only for it to come back stronger? Pastor Cristina addressed many of points that we as Christ followers fall short or sometimes do not even realize we are doing. How many times have we said \"if you are wiling..\"? Our Lord is always willing. Do we not know His heart? That is disbelief and demonic. It is okay to ask God for help to believe, He is a good Father. Never be content with where you are in your Christ walk , we must always strive to move further into His kingdom. We have conquered death, and chosen life everlasting. I encourage you to re-listen to this message. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 30, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso.\n"
