description: "When Jesus went to that cross, He looked ahead to the future and saw you. He saw your destiny, \"They will glorify me. They will obey me.\" Let us live up to the calling that He gave us. We need to throw off the weights that have been slowing us down - our own desires, our own timing. God has asked us to trust in Him. He loves your loved ones more that even you love them. Dare to believe God. Focus on His instructions. This season and 2021 is the season of the transfer of wealth, influence and affluence. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 28, 2021."
