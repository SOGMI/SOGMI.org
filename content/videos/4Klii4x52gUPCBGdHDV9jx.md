description: "Are you aware that you are a walking super hero? God's super hero. As silly as that may sound, you have been given a gift of the supernatural through our savior Jesus's death. Christ was able to walk in the supernatural, bring miracles to those in need. Guess what? We carry the same DNA as our Father who created us. This shouldn't be any surprise to any of us, after all we have been training for this our whole lives. Did you know that it is easier to prophesy to those that we do not know than to those we do. Our preconceived ideas we have for those we know clouds our clarity with God. This is not a time to be offended, a time to hold on to your past accomplishments, or for you to get a big head, like you are holier than thou. Be mindful of those who are looking to curve the conversation back to themselves, whether it be intentional or unintentional. These type of people will throw the whole message off that you are trying to get across. There's no need to try to set up your anointing, no need to try to gather anointing off of your own knowledge. Did Christ do that? No. He moved and everything else fell in line for Him. There was no place that he went that was not all part of God's grand plan. We are God's superheroes, all we need to do is be lead by the Holy Spirit and everything else will fall in line. I would encourage you to re-listen to this message as well as many others. This message was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International on July 23, 2023 by Pastor Cristina Sosso\n"
