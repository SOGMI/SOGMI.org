description: "In the same way our muscles can reach a plateau if we do the same workout routine over and over, our faith may be limited if we don't step out of our comfort zone. What we don't attempt in faith, we'll never accomplish! Pastor Josh discusses how we are conduits for the Holy Spirit and we can accomplish more for God by stepping out in faith. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church Interntional on September 13, 2020."
