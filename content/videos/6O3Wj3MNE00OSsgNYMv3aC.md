description: "Pastor Josh gave a powerful message this evening, reminding us to put Jesus as our cornerstone. He gives examples of how easy it is to adopt the worlds ways of thinking from the little things we take in the industries we have been put into. We must remember that our current positions are to tear down false idols and to turn eyes back to Christ. In the book of Judges the Israelites are charged by Joshua to keep their covenant with God or risk losing Gods hand over them. Unfortunately they failed at keeping it, because of their intermingling with the surrounding nations they were to drive out. \nIn the same way we are being charged with keeping our own covenants with God. Always remember that God our Father holds our best interest, so if you are feeling disciplined God has not given up on you. Our God is Good. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
