description: "This evening Pastor Joshua discusses on how we are the light of the world and the darkness must flee. Through our obedience, we become beacons of light to the world. God also says  we need to see the dark situations as what they can be, rather than what they are right now. So we shouldn't waste any more time looking and listening to the bad news because they are temporary. As we continue to obey, the darkness will continue to scatter."
