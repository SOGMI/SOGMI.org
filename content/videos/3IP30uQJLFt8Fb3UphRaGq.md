description: "Pastor Cristina delivers a powerful sermon about putting into action our instructions and that we are not just part time Christians. Our ministry in the kingdom does not end when the sermon is over. We are chosen to bring the kingdom of God down to earth. therefore we should not sit idlily by, but instead take action. The best way to give God all your attention is by a simple sentence: \"Here i am Lord.\"\nThis sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 10, 2022."
