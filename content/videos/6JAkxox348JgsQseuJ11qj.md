description: "Christians needs to ask themselves, \"if God examined my life in how I've lived this year will He be pleased with what He sees?\" We are leaving behind a legacy whether we obey God or not, it's up to us to make it a Good Legacy. God has already been moving across the United Staes. Texas has seen gains in economic growth, freedom, and advanced technology, because the State Texas has defended the unborn. This is also a season of Golden opportunities so seize every opportunity God give you and follow the instructions to the letter. this sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on December 19, 2021\n"
