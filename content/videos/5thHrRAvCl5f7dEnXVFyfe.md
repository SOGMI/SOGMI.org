description: "Pastor Josh discusses how the things of the spirit are different from the things of the natural. Remember how Elisha asked the Lord to open his servant's eyes to the supernatural and see they had chariots of fire on their side. Jesus remained calm when Lazarus and young girl were reported dead because He saw into the supernatural before He raised them from the dead. In these situations, the spiritual looked very different from the natural. Stand steadfast and be immovable knowing the power of the Lord! This sermon was given by Pastor Joshua Sosso on November 22nd, 2020 at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
