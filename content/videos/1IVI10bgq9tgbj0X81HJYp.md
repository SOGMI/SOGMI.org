description: "For the transfer of wealth influence and affluence to manifest in your life your obedience needs to be complete. All of those little responsibilities and instructions are important. The reason why the apostles didn't struggle to heal the sick and perform miracles was because their obedience was complete. In the same way we do not obey based on what we see or what you manifest. You do it based on what the Spirit of the Lord is saying. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on September 26, 2021."
