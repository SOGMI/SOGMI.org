description: "We each need to strive to live as God's perfect replicas, His standards are so perfect, that if we tried to live them out according to mans standards it would be impossible to achieve. Being that He is a good good Father he has given us grace, patience, and mercy, the ability to take possession over the nations that he has given us. Here's the best part about that, if our Father has given us the task to dethrone these nations, we know that He has our backs. He is a protector of His children, a father for the fatherless and the husband of the widows. If He has sent us nothing can be against us. This sermon was released at Freedom Fellowship Church International by Pastor Joshua Sosso on June 18, 2023.\n"
