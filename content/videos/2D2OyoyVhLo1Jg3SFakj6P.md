description: "Pastor Mike came with a powerful message today centering around God being in control in our nation. Despite what people are saying, God is using the Supreme Court to make changes in our country. He also references history and how our founding fathers learned to let God lead their deliberations and it gets rid of the headache! Pastor Mike also references Daniel 4 and how God showed King Nebuchadnezzar that he was in control, and it doesn't matter what the circumstances are. Then and now, God's word will reign, regardless of the situation."
