description: "As Christians we carry Christ Jesus in us wherever we go. Because of this sometimes we take Him places that he doesn't want to go. We need to remember that Jesus is with us always, and if we believe that then we will carry on a continual conversation with Him. Many Christians spiritualize talking to God, but that is supposed to be normal for us. We have Christ in us! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on March 24, 2021."
