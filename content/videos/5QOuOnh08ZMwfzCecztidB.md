description: "Pastor Josh recapped the Washington DC trip and how the Lord used the exploration day to reveal new ideas and concepts to him. Even in our days off or vacations, we need to consult the Holy Spirit on how to use our time. He also focuses heavily on the book of Corinthians and how Paul addresses the Corinth church. Today, Christians take parts of his letters and implement doctrines that are not meant for today's church. Pastor Josh instructs us to ask the Holy Spirit to lead us when learning the scripture. Always ask the Lord to reveal how to apply the scriptures we read. We need to turn to God before we do anything and find the joy in the areas we are placed in. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX."
