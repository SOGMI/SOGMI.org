description: "Jesus gave His authority to all of us.  We have to remove all the contaminations from our heart and mind and stand in unity. If we have a single area that is not implementing Gods ways then the mission will end in catastrophe. So this is why we need to become disciplined now, it should be none of us and all of him. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Joshua Sosso and Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship International on May 3, 2023."
