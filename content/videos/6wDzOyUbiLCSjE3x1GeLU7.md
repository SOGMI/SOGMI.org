description: "This morning Pastor Cristina talks about hearing the voice of God. This question is one of the most asked question Pastor Cristina comes across. You hear from God from the word, prophecy, and the pulpit. The more you seek the Father, the quicker you will find Him. (Matthew 7:7) Speak to our Father like you would a friend. He is always with you, and He is always listening. Over time you will notice that His voice will become clearer and clearer. His voice will always override the voice man. Questions to our Father is not frowned upon, our Father doesn't mind answering question, just like a father and his children. If the questions are important to you, it is important to Him. You are His first priority. Set aside time for Him and with Him. A time to read the bible, pray and just speak to Him. Go for a ride, just you and Him. Once we establish that relationship with our Father, He can begin to use you. He will be able tell you what moves to make who to avoid, and who to lead to Him. You may be thinking why me? Why not you? He used Saul of Tarsus. A man that we know as Apostle Paul, but prior to serving our Lord he was a persecutor of Believers. Faith and obedience is all that we need to be used by our Father.  \n"
