description: "Pastor Cris discusses the importance of letting the light shine. As Christians we are not supposed to focus on the darkness or how dark things are. We are the light of the world. We are supposed to drive back the darkness! In Genesis 1 it says that darkness was covering the earth, but God didn't focus on the darkness nor did He concern Himself with it. Instead God spoke, \"Let there be light,\" and light came. That is what God intends for us to do to the arts and entertainment and throughout the world. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on April 06, 2022."
