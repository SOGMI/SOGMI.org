description: "The prayer of a righteous man availeth much so Pastor Joshua encourages the Body to continue to pray during this pivotal point in our lives. In Zechariah 4:6 the Lord said to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit.' It is through God that the smallest become mighty and the display of His splendor will be seen in the world. He is mighty to save! This sermon was delivered by Pastor Josh Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on November 1, 2020."
