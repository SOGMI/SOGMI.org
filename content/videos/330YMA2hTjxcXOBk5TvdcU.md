description: "During this morning service, Pastor Cris reminds us that God doesn't show favoritism. Many Christians believe that Jewish people are special because they are the \"Apple of God's Eye\", but this is not true. It says in Ephesians 3:10 \"His intent was that now, through the Church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" So God's intent was always that through us, the Church, God's wisdom would be made known. In knowing this, we must act in a manner that properly represents God and His Kingdom. The Church must stop focusing on worldly things, such as our desires, or competition with one another. Instead, we must focus on heavenly things. It says in Colossians 3:1-2 \"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not earthly things.\" We have to begin establishing God's Kingdom and obeying him. If we are honest with ourselves many of us have not been productive in the Kingdom. We are stilling focusing on what we want and our plans rather than the Kingdom of God. This means we are still being earthly minded rather than being heavenly minded. These heart issues must be addressed in order to be used mightily by God. Purpose in your heart that you will obey God today and make corrections, and the first step in doing so is returning to your first love. Fall in love with Jesus and learn to obey Him and yield to him. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cristina Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on January 14, 2024.\n"
