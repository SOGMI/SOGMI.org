description: "Pastor Josh started off tonight with examples of maturing in life. Like we mature and take on the responsibilities of other people, the same thing happens in the Spirit. When you mature in Christ, God gives you more responsibility to pray for other situations across the world. Pastor Josh also reminds us to put our thinking and emotions aside, because they affect the promises God has given us. God will teach you everything you need to know, and you will affect the nations. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
