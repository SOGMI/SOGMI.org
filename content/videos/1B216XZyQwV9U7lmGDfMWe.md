description: "Pastor Cris discusses the importance of entering God's rest. In Hebrews 4:3-4 it says, \"For this good news — that God has prepared this rest — has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God. For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, \"'In my anger I took an oath: 'They will never enter my place of rest,'\" even though this rest has been ready since he made the world.\" The reason many Christians become busy without making any headway is because they are doing things their own way. When we trust and obey God that is when we enter God's rest. You cannot manifest the calling of God your life unless you enter God's rest. This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International on May 25, 2022."
