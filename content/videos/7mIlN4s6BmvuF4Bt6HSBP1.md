description: "We need to get back to the basics. Ask God for direction step by step and rely on the Holy Spirit in everything. That should be our primary focus. God wants to bring the Body of Christ into the supernatural realm. We are going to bring heaven down! If we obey God we are going to be the generation that manifests what was said in Revelation 11:15 \"The kingdom of the world has become, the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah...\" This sermon was delivered by Pastor Cris Sosso at Freedom Fellowship Church International."
