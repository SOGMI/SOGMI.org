description: "This evening, we had the pleasure of hearing from Deborah Ferrel. She discusses how we should let God move in our daily life rather than having a set list. We must get rid of the old ways of doing things in order to get into God's perfect will and inherit the things God has promised us. Our old ways are holding us back. This Christmas season, while we are giving and receiving gifts from others, we should prepare a gift for Jesus. The greatest gift we can give Jesus is becoming who he calls us to be. In order to becoming who we are called to be, we need to have a changed mindset to see major transformations in our lives. This sermon was delivered at Freedom Fellowship Church International in San Antonio, TX.\n"
